for fools who be wasting time\nContemplating on making up\nI ain't that guy\nA grudge holder\nI used to shove boulder in the counsel of my Aurora\nGet caught and tell 'em it's yours\nI can leave each one of ya body parts\nStranded in the middle of different forests\nHaving police ignore the shit\nNiggas get hung like ornaments\nWhile they hanging they trees\nThey get bombed like Vietnamese\nIn '46 or whatever year it was\nI gotta buzz\nAnd murdering you is all I love\nThis is Swifty McVay\nI ain't by myself\nI got Em, Proof, and Stat that be hot\nAnd D12 is over, D12 is over here\nAnd yo' death

backwards\nAnd play it back later\nCause all y'all haters rockin' gators\nAlligators, we see ya later\nWe ain't player haters\nBut yo check it out\nWe rockin' in our Navigators\nAnd we can sit back\nAnd we can stretch, we can check\nTrek, I mean catch, anything\nAnd we can fetch\nI'm slurring a little bit\nBut during the part that I was doing\nThe urination, upon that girl and\nWait a minute, I ain't goin'\nThere with my rap\nI ain't tryin' to be starting no crap\nBut yo, I be flowin'\nWith the stuff and I be knowin'\nThat when I start raking out them leaves\nI be hoein'\nAnd that's six in the mornin'\nAnd we can do it\nWe can get it on until the crack of dawn and\nWe can get it on with Tim Westwood\nWe can do whatever you want\nBring ya best cause\nWe do what we want to do\nOn this microphone\nCause we ought to know\nOr ought to inform you\nThat we get warm too warm\nSometimes we too hot to\nNot to spit this ish\nSpit it backwards and that said shit\nWhoops, I didn't mean to curse\nBut yo Proof, come back\nAnd lay one verse\n\n[Proof]\nI don't bite\nBut I spit the killin' venom\nWhen I'm older\nMy pockets gon' blow up like Brazilian women\nYou can fight me here\nLike some Big (B.I.G.) and Pac shit\nBreaking laws off him dog\nAnd hypnotic, he got it\nAlthough he sound sober\nI ain't gay nowhere near gay\nI even hate a brown-noser\nIt's over, he killa\nGot no skills\nWhen these twenty-two spins\nAin't got nothing to do with Diablo wheels\nEven the bible kills\nI burn moral themes\nY'all pop like MTV\nAnd talk more than Coral Jeanne\nThe poor foreseen that there is a God\nI hope you guys slack\nCause when I lean back\nWithout the Terror Squad\nI gotta two bigger\nThen pistol move niggas whip\nI leave fool ass lit\nLike a cool cigarette\nI'm 'bout the peace dude\nIn fact the peaceful\nSince these niggas know my piece full\nAnd since they watchin' Beef too\nThey watchin' niggas out here\nThey see how we go\nBack in the day\nWith what, my people\nThe desert eagle\nLeaving people living in deceased holes\nHow they feel about that?\nMy truck is all diesel\nFreeze hoes\nThese people know it\nG.L. in detail\nThey break like Lee nail\nCrew is D12\nMore noise than a seashell\nCause we shall prevail\nWithout the Martin Luther King drill\n\n[Eminem]\nHow you know the main side, so attraction\nPsycho action\nThe man 'ill throw up on Michael Jackson\nSick enough to do anything\nIn any video\nI could even pull out my whole titty yo\nWouldn't mean a damn thing\nWouldn't mean nothing\nLike if you went and pulled hamstring\nCause you a fake 'iatch\nI took the b off\nCause Imma be off with the switch\nJust like you\nCause you walk with a switch too\nThat's what I meant\nCause I represent, every single day\nPass

group\nGrizzles, love me cause my smile is priceless\nMy advice, my life\nI have them wetter than diapers\nShe want me to buy big jewels and wife her\nFuck the bitch tonight\nBut tomorrow won't like her\nGo back to the club\nAnd get a new one like her\nAnd that's what I call completing a cypher\nWrassle with the bitches so they call me Roddy Piper\nWhen a Stat come through\nYour girlfriend get hyper\n\n[Swift]\nYou be in the ocean with the worms and maggots\nI'm what overdoses do for an addict\nAnd after static with me\nHoly ghosts will be given a homes\nAutomatically, it's either that or be rolled in a hole\nI target ya dome\nWatch that shit get blown\nLike a head gasket\nSee I'm rabid\nAnd known to foam acid\nI accurately mastered battering bastards\nI don't get charged for assault and battery\nThey be after me\nCause I smashed 'em\nHappily answering\nAny nigga that asks me would happen\nI tell 'em the truth laughin'\nThat's just me\nA five-star general\nWith aura that's horrible\nI be smackin' ya captain\nTurn a corpse into ya corporal\nThey won't know who did it\nTell your lieutenant\nWhen an arsenal is set\nFor all of those threats of coming close\nNo you won't\nWith a Stephen King mentality\nYa don't believe me?\nI can bring the casualty to ya family\nAnd that's what's up\nI got D12 in the house\nYa know what we about\nAre you a man, a mouse?\nAnd it seems like you a mouse\nRunning in that hole\nJust cause you hoe\nAnd everybody know\nMcVay yeah\n\n[Proof]\nSee I'm going out\nBlow 'em up\nThey wanna see me, what I'm all about\nPull 'em out\nI'm in

the window\nAight cut it, cook it, bag it\nDistribute it through the city\nHome get that cabbage\nTake it, flip it\nTurn illegal to legal\nLaunder, stay grindin'\nKeepin' ya business on the under\nHumble moves come up\nCops run up\nBut most of them corrupt\nSo what?\nThey want they cut\nSo pay 'em\nAll those who oppose the squad\nSpray 'em\nGot goons with MACs\nWho kill for scratch\nOkay I'm\nOne quick trip 'ill\nAnd get you filled with gas\nBroad day and niggas 'ill kill you\nWithout the mask\nI'm getting bank\nLike I'm shooting it from off the glass\nSigned with Shady-Aftermath\nCause I'm after cash\nBiatch\n\n[Verse 2: Swift]\nThe way it go\nJust heard my dog\nStat Quo flow\nHa, ya heard what he had to say\nUse the words Swifty McVay\nI'm ill enough to shoot a nigga through his pager\nAnd if I missed\nThe shit's going exactly through his neighbor\nMy behavior's\nFatal enough to faint niggas\nOld age and cradle\nI shoot from unexpected angles\nI changed ya facials\nI could have you niggas hugging an angel\nLiterally\nNiggas be crazy\nI'm misery, breaking both of ya ankles\nI diminish mentally\nI turn you into a mimic of Kennedy\nI don't go to sleep 'till I murder motherfuckers in trilogies\nI recruit enemies\nFriends ain't shit\nThey take yo ends and split\nWillingly\nWhat kind of shit got a nigga faking the funk\nDressed like George Clinton\nBut you hoes ain't making a buck\nYou out and about\nWith yo face frostbit\nWith a hustlin' mouth\nBut you really full of brussels sprouts\nHusband or spouse\nYour generation's running out\nBecause my gun's in ya mouth\nPenetration coming (cumming) fast\nWe won, you lost\nYou got a witness program\nMove out cold then John Walsh\nWild\nAnd this the way we do\nEmzy, Imma pass it to you\nSo what ya wanna do?\n\n[Pre-Verse: Eminem]\nWhat I wanna do? What I wanna do?\nLet me see right here, yo\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nNot many people that I label would be able\nTo display table manners, but our plan is\nTo make this beat rock like scanners and make the fans just\nGo bananas, yo, get our planners\nThat means our nuts for the sluts who don't under-\nStand this, yo, my plan is, yeah right\nAnd y'all gon' stand there and act like you don't understand it\nLike my name is Janet, my titty fell out and I ain't plan it\nYo, check this\u2014check this out\nAnd if you rocking with ya necklace out, that's my breakfast now\nI'mma snatch it, yo, my style is wretched\nYou can't fetch it, no you can't stretch it\nAnd yo, it doesn't really matter\nCause ya name I can't even pronunciate, you the\u2014\nSame type of mo'fucker to go and sucker\nPunch Dre at the Vibe Awards, but he right behind the boards\nThe next day, so kiss an ass\nOr kiss a dick, lick a dick, eat my ass\nWhatever you won' do it's on you\nBig Proof coming through with the mo\u2014\n\n[Verse 4: Proof]\nY'all niggas sing\nY'all done came to the Nina Ross war\nYa homie's a killa\nBut my killas they cost more\nIt's all inherited\nI was boss born\nPut eighteen in ya flesh\nAnd make ya chest a golf course\nNiggas know that we ain't even\nYou know why\n(gasps) I'm still breathin'\nYeah I got that real heathen\nWith them steel beams on 'em\nThrough ya dreams on 'em\nLike I'm still a fiend\nNoted for mics\nIt's only right\nYou see my real team, brody\nI do it live\nI was sippin' on some cream soda\nHeave phony\nFuck this back and forth\nThis ain't a tennis meet\nI spray you industry gangstas\nCause they ain't in the streets\nIt's cool to beef\nBut why?\n'Till you truce with or you trust me\nI told you Puffy\nAnd you can lose Big (B.I.G.)\nI'm Proof\nWho you could do big things with us\nSpit dope\nThey call me Rick James bitch\nClip-clack\nBang-hit\nBang-drip\nDrip fang of blood\nDrip, drip, drank when sirens cop came\nBody bag thick\nBody bag, zip-zip\nThat's it\nFuck you bitch\n\n[Stat Quo]\nDown a dark street\nIt's the dirty Stat Quo\nLord have mercy\nBreathe, hello I'm 'bout my cheese\nThe steez, mellow\nCash in the bank\nOn my grind in the paint\nOh, look how I do live with my boy Westwood\nUp to no good\nSmoking that good shit\nSee how I ball\nHandle, handle my business\nEminem, Swift, P, Stat Quo that's it\nBack on the track\nGreen Lantern done switched the beat\nI'm guaranteed to my thang and drop the heat\nMy man Zeke is in the corner with him\nBoss Hog, A-town, yes I be them\nDo what I do freestyle, top of the dome\nDon't fuck with my click\nLeave Doc Dre alone\nIf I see you out the wars\nImma stab yo' ass\nWhoop yo' ass\nYa fuck with me\nI make ya handicap\nAnd I pass the mic to my man Swifty\nMcVay he

one of ya body parts\nStranded in the middle of different forests\nHaving police ignore the shit\nNiggas get hung like ornaments\nWhile they hanging they trees\nThey get bombed like Vietnamese\nIn '46 or whatever year it was\nI gotta buzz\nAnd murdering you is all I love\nThis is Swifty McVay\nI ain't by myself\nI got Em, Proof, and Stat that be hot\nAnd D12 is over, D12 is over here\nAnd yo' death

that's six in the mornin'\nAnd we can do it\nWe can get it on until the crack of dawn and\nWe can get it on with Tim Westwood\nWe can do whatever you want\nBring ya best cause\nWe do what we want to do\nOn this microphone\nCause we ought to know\nOr ought to inform you\nThat we get warm too warm\nSometimes we too hot to\nNot to spit this ish\nSpit it backwards and that said shit\nWhoops, I didn't mean to curse\nBut yo Proof, come back\nAnd lay one verse\n\n[Proof]\nI don't bite\nBut I spit the killin' venom\nWhen I'm older\nMy pockets gon' blow up like Brazilian women\nYou can fight me

killa\nGot no skills\nWhen these twenty-two spins\nAin't got nothing to do with Diablo wheels\nEven the bible kills\nI burn moral themes\nY'all pop like MTV\nAnd talk more than Coral Jeanne\nThe poor foreseen that there is a God\nI hope you guys slack\nCause when I lean back\nWithout the Terror Squad\nI gotta two bigger\nThen pistol move niggas whip\nI leave fool ass lit\nLike a cool cigarette\nI'm 'bout the peace dude\nIn fact the peaceful\nSince these niggas know my piece full\nAnd since they watchin' Beef too\nThey watchin' niggas out here\nThey see how we go\nBack in the day\nWith what, my people\nThe desert eagle\nLeaving people living in deceased holes\nHow they feel about that?\nMy truck is all diesel\nFreeze hoes\nThese people know it\nG.L. in detail\nThey break like Lee nail\nCrew is D12\nMore noise than a seashell\nCause we shall prevail\nWithout the Martin Luther King drill\n\n[Eminem]\nHow you know the main side, so attraction\nPsycho action\nThe man 'ill throw up on Michael Jackson\nSick enough to do anything\nIn any video\nI could even pull out my whole titty yo\nWouldn't mean a damn thing\nWouldn't mean nothing\nLike if you went and pulled hamstring\nCause you a fake 'iatch\nI took the b off\nCause Imma be off with the switch\nJust like you\nCause you walk with a switch too\nThat's what I meant\nCause I represent, every single day\nPass

be rolled in a hole\nI target ya dome\nWatch that shit get blown\nLike a head gasket\nSee I'm rabid\nAnd known to foam acid\nI accurately mastered battering bastards\nI don't get charged for assault and battery\nThey be after me\nCause I smashed 'em\nHappily answering\nAny nigga that asks me would happen\nI tell 'em the truth laughin'\nThat's just me\nA five-star general\nWith aura that's horrible\nI be smackin' ya captain\nTurn a corpse into ya corporal\nThey won't know who did it\nTell your lieutenant\nWhen an arsenal is set\nFor all of those threats of coming close\nNo you

probably be a lot less hostile\nIf you snots kept your schnozzes out the air holes\nYou'll get fucked in all seven holes\nAss, mouth, pussy yeah, both ears and ha yes nostrils\nAt the OzzFest with Nas\nBumping Das EFX in a wrecked up Datsun\nAnd dropped two extra strength Watson Vicodin out my pocket\nThey cost less\nI'm a hot mess\nCause I tripped and got my head stuck\nIn a wasps nest in the process, awesome\nDrunk as fuck, one sock\nPulling my boxers up with boxing gloves\nBut I keep dropping my fucking binoculars\nGot two fucking Hydroxycuts\nAnd four oxi\u2019s stuck in my esophogus\nThese three lesbian little stocky sluts\nThought I swallowed two hockey pucks\nStarted screaming \"serves you right you cocky fuck\nThat's what you get for mocking us\nAin't as cool as you thought you was\"\nBitch all I did when I walked up was have my dick in a sock\nSaid it was a sock puppet\nSo no strings attached\nYou can all suck it\nChicka get it, ah fuck it\nShit\u2019s bout to

life\nToo late\n(I can't keep chasing you\nI'm taking my life back)\nCaught in a chase, 25 to life\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made\nMaybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed\nBut I've already wasted over half my life, I woulda laid\nDown and died for you, I no longer cry for you, no more pain\nBitch, you took me for granted\nTook my heart and ran it straight into the planet\nInto the dirt, I can no longer stand it, now my respect, I demand it\nI'ma take control of this relationship, command it\nAnd I'ma be the boss of you now, goddamn it\nAnd what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me\nSo you better hear me out, this much you owe me\nI gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed\nFaithful all the way, this is how I fuckin' get repaid?\nLook at how I dress, fuckin' baggy sweats, go to work a mess\nAlways in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet\nNot even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect\nI've done my best to give you nothin' less than perfectness\nAnd I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothin' left\nBut you keep treatin' me like a staircase: it's time to fuckin' step\nAnd I won't be comin' back, so don't hold your fuckin' breath\nYou know what you've done, no need to go in-depth\nI told you you'd be sorry if I fuckin' left\nI laughed while you wept, how's it feel now?\nYeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me\nDid me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set\nBut a special place for you in my heart I have kept\nIt's unfortunate, but it's\u2026\n\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase, 25 to life\n(Can't take no more)\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase, 25 to life\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI feel like when I bend over backwards for you, all you do is laugh\n\u2018Cause that ain't good enough\nYou expect me to fold myself in half 'til I snap\nDon't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap\nHow can I moonlight on the side? I have no life outside of that\nDon't I give you enough of my time? You don't think so, do you?\nJealous when I spend time with the girls\nWhy I'm married to you still? Man, I don't know\nBut tonight I'm serving you with papers\nI'm divorcing you \u2013 go marry someone else and make 'em famous!\nAnd take away their freedom like you did to me\nTreat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you\nFeed 'em the same shit that you made me eat\nI'm moving on, forget you\nOh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you\nAll I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch\nChew me up and spit me out, I fell for this\nSo many times it's ridiculous\nAnd still I stick with this, I'm sick of this\nBut in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get\nEvil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em\nMy friends keep askin' me why I can't just walk away from\nI'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama\nI'm drawn to shit, I guess I'm a\nMess, cursed and blessed, but this time I\nAin't changin' my mind, I'm climbin' out this abyss\nYou're screamin' as I walk out that I'll be missed\nBut when you spoke of people\nWho meant the most to you, you left me off your list\nFuck you, hip hop! I'm leavin' you\nMy life sentence is served, bitch, and it's just...\n\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase, 25 to life\n(I'm gone, man)\nToo late for the other side\nCaught in a chase, 25 to life\nToo late\nCaught in a chase, 25 to life"}}, {"title": "313", "album": "Infinite", "year": "1996-11-12", "lyrics": "[Hook: Eye-Kyu]\nNow, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?\nNone of these skills you 'bout to see come free\nSo you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me\nIf you ever wanna be one, see\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNow, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?\nNone of these skills you 'bout to see come free\nSo you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me\nIf you ever wanna be one, see\n\n[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]\nYo, some people say I'm whack, now if that's right I'm\nThe freshest whack MC that you ever heard in your lifetime\nMy slick acapella sounds clever with the beats, boy\nI'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets\nForget a gold digger's succubus\nMy soul's thick with ruggedness\nWith the mic I'm like a dyke: can't no nigga fuck with this\nI got more different strokes than Philip Drummound\nOn open mic I bone your woman\nJust to keep my lyrics comin' (bitch)\nWe elevated to new heights, premeditated\nLet it be that I stated, they hate it\nNow that they see that I made it\nThe escalated can be put to the test of greatness\nSnatch the heart from MC's and I ate it\nSo I take it, that's the reason I'm hated\nTo represent's my temperament\nIf rap was a dick, all you so called hard MC's would not be impotent, but pimpin' it\nAnd actin' like you could rock a show\nHarder than LL's rock the bells, and you's a hoe\nEverything that you collaborate I lacerate\nMy rhymes they keep comin'\nLike nymphomaniacs that masturbate\nAt a faster rate, yeah, I got somethin' for your ass to hate\nI blast your hate, and have you all runnin' past the gates\nAnd as for face clutchin' and touchin' the flows\nI got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose\nBuckin' these hoes, I got that shit down to a science\nLeavin' them hot and bothered, turned on, like an appliance\nDefiance?

with the real skills and act like you know\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNow, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?\nNone of these skills you 'bout to see come free\nSo you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me\nIf you ever wanna be one, see\n\n[Hook: Eye-Kyu]\nNow, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?\nNone of these skills you 'bout to see come free\nSo you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me\nIf you ever wanna be one, see\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nSo what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?\nYou don't know shit, so when you see one, flee\nYou can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC\nI stopped the alphabet at S and got it down to a T\nI'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet MC crash the spot\nI'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott\nYour ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me\nI'll run your brain round the block to jog your fuckin' memory\nIt's either them or me, man, kill or be killed\nYour will'll be sealed, your casket closed, you still'll be billed\nMy facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity\nI'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty\nIf he's actin' soft and he cowers, he better come cleaner\nThan Jeru jackin' off when he showers\nYou flowers got no clout with a thing\nYou could date a stick of dynamite\nAnd wouldn't go out with a bang\nI shout with a slang, simple as ABC's\nSkip over the D's and rock the microphone with ease\nDethrone MC's, and I'ma max alone\nRelax your dome, like a solo from a saxophone\nSo facts are known, biters get treated with shots\nI rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks\nI'm greeted with flocks of fellow followers' singers\nYou couldn't make the fans throw up their hands\nIf they swallowed their fingers\nBut you can bring yours, let's see what you got\nBut don't front, and never try to be what you're not\n'Cause you can be quick\nJump the candlestick, burn your back\nAnd fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't jack\n\n[Hook: Eye-Kyu]\nNow, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?\nNone of these skills that you just seen come free\nSo you wanna be a sweet MC, you never become me\nSo you ain't never gonna be one, see\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNow, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?\nNone of these skills you 'bout to see come free\nSo you wanna be a sweet MC, you never become me\nIf you ever wanna be one, see", "image":

skills you 'bout to see come free\nSo you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me\nIf you ever wanna be one, see\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nNow, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?\nNone of these skills you 'bout to see come free\nSo you wanna be a sweet MC, you better become me\nIf you ever wanna be one, see\n\n[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]\nYo, some people say I'm whack, now if that's right I'm\nThe freshest whack MC that you ever heard in your lifetime\nMy slick acapella sounds clever with the beats, boy\nI'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets\nForget a gold digger's succubus\nMy soul's thick with ruggedness\nWith the mic I'm like a dyke: can't no nigga fuck with this\nI got more different strokes than Philip Drummound\nOn open mic I bone your woman\nJust to keep my lyrics comin' (bitch)\nWe elevated to new heights, premeditated\nLet it be that I stated, they hate it\nNow that they see that I made it\nThe escalated can be put to the test of greatness\nSnatch the heart from MC's and I ate it\nSo I take it, that's the reason I'm hated\nTo represent's my temperament\nIf rap was a dick, all you so called hard MC's would not be impotent, but pimpin' it\nAnd actin' like you could rock a show\nHarder than LL's rock the bells, and you's a hoe\nEverything that you collaborate I lacerate\nMy rhymes they keep comin'\nLike nymphomaniacs that masturbate\nAt a

(Ayo)\nGoodnight, goodbye!\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou're walkin' down a horror corridor\nIt's almost four in the mornin' and you're in a\nNightmare, it's horrible, right there's the coroner\nWaiting for ya to turn the corner so he can corner ya\nYou're a goner, he's onto ya\nOut the corner of his cornea, he just saw ya run\nAll you want is to rest 'cause you can't run anymore, you're done\nAll he wants is to kill you in front of an audience\nWhile everybody is watching in the party, applauding it\nHere I sit, while I'm caught up in deep thought again\nContemplating my next plot again\nSwallowin' a Klonopin while I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman\nAt the Ramada Inn, holding onto the pill bottle, then\nLick my finger and swirl it 'round the bottom\nAnd make sure I got all of it\nWake up naked at McDonald's with\nBlood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit\nGuess I must've just blacked out again\u2014not again!\n\n[Hook]\nIt's 3 a.m. in the mornin'\nPut my key in the door and\nBodies layin' all over the floor and\nI don't remember how they got there\nBut I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em\nI said, it's 3 a.m. in the mornin'\nPut my key in the door and\nBodies layin' all over the floor and\nI don't remember how they got there\nBut I guess I must've killed 'em, killed 'em\n\n[Verse 2]\nSitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon\nI wonder what's on the tube, maybe they'll show some boobs\nSurfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana then\nI reach for the aloe and lanolin, bust all over the wall panellin'\nDismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantel and\nGrab my flannel and my bandana, then\nKiss the naked mannequin man again\nYou can see him standin' in my front window if you look in\nI'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens\nCausin' illusions again, brain contusions again\nCutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors, and pins\nJesus, when does it end?

I was born with a set of horns\nAnd metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord\nWarlord of rap that'll bash you with a two by four board\nAnd smash into your Honda Accord with a 4-door Ford\nBut I'm more toward droppin' an acapella\nTo chop a fella into mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller\nGot you locked in the cellar with your skeleton showing\nDeveloping anorexia while I'm standin' next to ya\nEating a four course meal, watching you starve to death\nWith an IV in your veins, feeding you liquid Darvocet\nPumping you full of drugs\nPull the plugs\nOn the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs\nWho were picked up in an ambulance\nAnd driven\nTo receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants\nAnd given\nA less than 20 percent chance\nOf living\nHave a possible placement\nAs a hospital patient\nStoring the dead bodies in grandma's little basement\nDoctor Kevorkian has arrived\nTo perform an autopsy on you while you scream \"I'M STILL ALIVE!\"\nDriving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp, and\nPullin' your Adam's apple out through your mouth\nBetter call the fire department\nI've hired a arson\nTo set fire to carpet\nAnd burn up your entire apartment\nI'm a liar to start shit\nGot your bitch wrapped around my dick\nSo tight you need a crowbar to pry her apart with\nMotherfucker, Slim Shady bitch! Recognize!\n\n[Verse 2]\nMet a retarded kid named Greg, with a wooden leg\nSnatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg\nGo to bed with the keg, wake up with the 40\nMixed it with Alka-Seltzer and Formula 44D\nFuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead\nWait until it absorbed in, and fell to the floor dead\nNo more said, case closed, end of discussion\nI'm blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion\nLeaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas\nCross the bombers\nWe blowin' up your house, killing your parents\nAnd coming back to get your foster mommas\nAnd I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus\nCause I ain't making no more threats\nI'm doin' drive-by's in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets\nI'm more or less sick in the head\nMaybe more cause I smoked crack\nToday, yesterday, and the day before\nSaboteur, walk the block with a Labrador\nStrappin' more corral for war than El Salvador\nFoul style galore\nVerbal cow manure\nComin' together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure!\nMotherfucker!\n\n[Verse 3]\n(Like this, like that, like this\nLike this, like that, like this)\nI'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless, patrolling corners\nLooking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters\nI'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr\nAnd smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments\nI grew up in a wild hood\nAs a hazardous youth\nWith a fucked up childhood\nThat I used as an excuse\nAnd ain't shit changed\nI kept the same mindstate\nSince the third time that I failed 9th grade\nYou probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it\nI don't promote violence, I just encourage it\nI laugh at the sight of death\nAs I fall down a cement flight of steps\nAnd land inside a bed of spider webs\nSo throw caution to the wind\nYou and a friend\nCan jump off of a bridge, and if you live, do it again\nShit, why not? Blow your brain out\nI'm blowing mine out\nFuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now\n\n[Verse 4]\nYo, yo, yo!\nMy mom sent me up to the store with a food stamp\nFor a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (here)\nTwo dudes ran up and jumped out of a blue van\nI looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch\nI swung it at the first dude, the other one with him\nSeen it snap so fast, it looked like it broke before it hit him\nSo he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him\nHe came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming \"GET HIM!\"\nI grabbed one,  lit him on fire, pinned, and bit him\nThe next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him\nOne by one I just kept dropin' 'em in a rhythm\nThen I woke up swingin' the middle of the kitchen\n\n(Damn... damn... damn...)"}}, {"title": "50 Ways", "album": null, "year": "2011-03-23", "lyrics": "[Verse 1: Eminem]\nYou probably gonna think that I'm talking\nAbout you and you goddamn right I am\nLook at you, this is the minimal I could diss you\nSubliminally, but I think criminal instinct\nHas pushed me to the brink, my pussy does it stink\nHe still loves me 'cause he puts me in his ink\nHe does, doesn't he, still is, isn't he?\nNah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart 'cause he misses me\nI can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky\nAnd is no risk of disease 'cause he ain't with anyone is he?\nThis bitch really thinks she can get me\nIf she still wants me, driving across country\nStrapped up to the front seat, missing all her front teeth\nThinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me?\nI told this cunt she's gonna overdo it once\nAnd once she does, she was stuffed up in a trunk\nCrunch, he scrunched her up in a ball\nBunched up nice and comfy\nFuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me\nYou cunning little cunt, deceitful witch\nYou thought you had me, 'till my shrink told me this\n\n[Hook: Paul Simon]\nThe problem is all inside your head she said to me\nThe answer is easy if you take it logically\nI'd like to help you in your struggle to be free\nThere must be 50 ways to leave your lover\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI feel like a serial killer, I keep dumping bodies in the lake\nI'mma get caught and send up the river\nI shiver when I think of the company I keep\nHow do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep\nI shriek, every time she hands me something to drink\nSex kept us together, when we slept together every-thing\nWas all better, she made me feel like a king\nSlowly she began lowering my self-esteem\nShe go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her\nAnd I just bought her a truck for 50,000 dollars\nAccused me of doing drugs and scream n' holla\nThen I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana\nAnd all I know is every time I go\nTo them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow\nThe little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke\nThat's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago\nAnd I wouldn't even let on like I know\nWhat was I supposed to do?

cunt, deceitful witch\nYou thought you had me, 'till my shrink told me this\n\n[Hook: Paul Simon]\nThe problem is all inside your head she said to me\nThe answer is easy if you take it logically\nI'd like to help you in your struggle to be free\nThere must be 50 ways to leave your lover\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI feel like a serial killer, I keep dumping bodies in the lake\nI'mma get caught and send up the river\nI shiver when I think of the company I keep\nHow do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep\nI shriek, every time she hands me something to drink\nSex kept us together, when we slept together every-thing\nWas all better, she made me feel like a king\nSlowly she began lowering my self-esteem\nShe go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her\nAnd I just bought her a truck for 50,000 dollars\nAccused me of doing drugs and scream n' holla\nThen I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana\nAnd all I know is every time I go\nTo them hiding spots, wherever she hides her blow\nThe little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke\nThat's growing smaller, and that was just a while ago\nAnd I wouldn't even let on like I know\nWhat was I supposed to do? Call her out on it, we just argue\nSay she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script\nOoh she's a manipulative evil bitch\nA cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch\nShe thought she had me, 'till my shrink told me this\n\n[Hook: Paul Simon]\nThe problem is all inside your head she said to me\nThe answer is easy if you take it logically\nI'd like to help you in your struggle to be free\nThere must be 50 ways to leave your lover"}}, {"title": "8 Mile", "album": "8 Mile: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture", "year": "2002-10-29", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nIt's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway\n\n[Verse 1]\nSometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might\nWhy do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?\nSometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life\nSometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics\nAnd show these people what my level of skill's like\nBut I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life\nSomethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights\nCase of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like\nDa-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault\nGreat big eyeballs, my insides crawl\nAnd I clam up [wham],\u200b I just slam shut\nI just can't do it, my whole manhood's\nJust been stripped, I have just been vicked\nSo I must then get off the bus, then split\nMan, fuck this shit, yo I'm goin' the fuck home\nWorld on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a man, I'ma make a new plan\nTime for me to just stand up and travel new land\nTime to really just take matters into my own hands\nOnce I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back\n(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'\nSorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone\nAin't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own\nOnly way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back\nThe spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap\nTo the same plant, in the same pants\nTryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP\nAnd get a new plan, Momma's got a new man\nPoor little baby sister, she don't understand\nSits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad\nAnd just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand\nWhile she colors her big brother and mother and dad\nAin't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head\nWish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had\nBut I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad\nSometimes I get upset, \u2018cause I ain't blew up yet\nIt's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet\nDon't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep\nThe pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best\nAnd I try, sit alone and I cry\nYo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by\nThat I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God\nPlease don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job\nYo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are\nYo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow\nTell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye\nSay whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far\nBut yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know\nAnd I'ma be back for you the second that I blow\nOn everything I own, I'll make it on my own\nOff to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a man, gotta make a new plan\nTime for me to just stand up and travel new land\nTime to really just take matters into my own hands\nOnce I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back\n(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'\nSorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone\nAin't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own\nOnly way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it\nOr see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is\nTo be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits\nIt's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate\nOf authenticity, you'd never even see\nBut it's everything to me, it's my credibility\nYou never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC\nWho's incredible upon the same pedestal as me\nBut yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time\nSit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes\nGo to work and serve MC's in the lunchline\nBut when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?\nWho must I show to bust my flow?\nWhere must I go? Who must I know?\nOr am I just another crab in the bucket?\n\u2018Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it\nMaybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit\nI'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with\nI look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit\nAt the Salvation Army tryin' to salvage an outfit\nAnd it's cold, tryna travel this road\nPlus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode\nMy defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want\nIs pity from no one, this city is no fun\nThere is no sun, and it's so dark\nSometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart\nFrom each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends\nIt's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin\nSometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not\nWhat I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top\nI just explode, the kettle gets so hot\nSometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got\nBut I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn\nYo, it only takes one time for me to get burned\nAin't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl\nI can no longer play stupid or be immature\nI got every ingredient, all I need is the courage\nLike I already got the beat, all I need is the words\nGot the urge, suddenly it's a surge\nSuddenly a new burst of energy has occurred\nTime to show these Free World leaders the 3 and a third\nI am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird\nThen I turn and cross over the median curb\nHit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a man, gotta make a new plan\nTime for me to just stand up and travel new land\nTime to really just take matters into my own hands\nOnce I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back\n(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'\nSorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone\nAin't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own\nOnly way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road", "image": "https://images.genius.com/e4a1bd93e045b909843de21d49a9bb97.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist": "Eminem", "raw": {"annotation_count": 26, "api_path": "/songs/914", "apple_music_id": "1017954", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/914/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "Off the soundtrack to the semi-autobiographical 8 Mile, Eminem tells a story similar to what goes on throughout the movie.

I'm gonna make it anyway\n\n[Verse 1]\nSometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might\nWhy do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?\nSometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life\nSometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics\nAnd show these people what my level of skill's like\nBut I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life\nSomethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights\nCase of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like\nDa-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault\nGreat big eyeballs, my insides crawl\nAnd I clam up [wham],\u200b I just slam shut\nI just can't do it, my whole manhood's\nJust been stripped, I have just been vicked\nSo I must then get off the bus, then split\nMan, fuck this shit, yo I'm goin' the fuck home\nWorld on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a man, I'ma make a new plan\nTime for me to just stand up and travel new land\nTime to really just take matters into my own hands\nOnce I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back\n(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'\nSorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone\nAin't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own\nOnly way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back\nThe spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap\nTo the same plant, in the same pants\nTryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP\nAnd get a new plan, Momma's got a new man\nPoor little baby sister, she don't understand\nSits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad\nAnd just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand\nWhile she colors her big brother and mother and dad\nAin't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head\nWish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had\nBut I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad\nSometimes I get upset, \u2018cause I ain't blew up yet\nIt's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet\nDon't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep\nThe pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best\nAnd I try, sit alone and I cry\nYo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by\nThat I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God\nPlease don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job\nYo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are\nYo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow\nTell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye\nSay whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far\nBut yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know\nAnd I'ma be back for you the second that I blow\nOn everything I own, I'll make it on my own\nOff to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a man, gotta make a new plan\nTime for me to just stand up and travel new land\nTime to really just take matters into my own hands\nOnce I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back\n(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'\nSorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone\nAin't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own\nOnly way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it\nOr see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is\nTo be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits\nIt's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate\nOf authenticity, you'd never even see\nBut it's everything to me, it's my credibility\nYou never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC\nWho's incredible upon the same pedestal as me\nBut yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time\nSit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes\nGo to work and serve MC's in the lunchline\nBut when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?\nWho must I show to bust my flow?\nWhere must I go? Who must I know?\nOr am I just another crab in the bucket?\n\u2018Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it\nMaybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit\nI'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with\nI look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit\nAt the Salvation Army tryin' to salvage an outfit\nAnd it's cold, tryna travel this road\nPlus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode\nMy defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want\nIs pity from no one, this city is no fun\nThere is no sun, and it's so dark\nSometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart\nFrom each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends\nIt's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin\nSometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not\nWhat I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top\nI just explode, the kettle gets so hot\nSometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got\nBut I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn\nYo, it only takes one time for me to get burned\nAin't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl\nI can no longer play stupid or be immature\nI got every ingredient, all I need is the courage\nLike I already got the beat, all I need is the words\nGot the urge, suddenly it's a surge\nSuddenly a new burst of energy has occurred\nTime to show these Free World leaders the 3 and a third\nI am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird\nThen I turn and cross over the median curb\nHit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road\n\n[Hook]\nI'm a man, gotta make a new plan\nTime for me to just stand up and travel new land\nTime to really just take matters into my own hands\nOnce I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back\n(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'\nSorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone\nAin't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own\nOnly way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road"}}, {"title": "8 Mile: 313 Cypher (Chin Tiki Girls)", "album": "8 Mile (Battles, Cyphers & Freestyles)", "year": "2002-11-09", "lyrics": "[Parking Lot Rapper #2 (Obie Trice)]\nI use my voice to spit the fiery frame\nTry and refrain, dying in vain\nSoon as I reply in [?]\nI be the nigga in the Shelter who be eyeing your chain\n\n[Parking Lot Rapper #3 (Njeri Earth)]\nThree-one-three area, bound to bury ya with vengeance\nMy rhymes sentences'll put an end to your existence with the rigorousness\nNiggas, I'm serious, delirious, cause a curious... pause\nThe fury calls from my jaws from devouring y'all raw\n\n[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]\nYou forced to listen to the individual, the metaphysical\nThe Mac Mitten, rhyme ritual, heterosexual\nSyllables they sound complex to you, lines perplexing you\nWith words that could put a hex on you, snap that neck on you\nMurder you, boil you, we keep a white boy or two\nLet my man grab the mic, you see how Bunny Rabbit do\n\n[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]\nYour style is generic, mine's authentic made\nI roll like a renegade, you need clinic aid\nMy technique is bizarre and ill; I scar and kill\nYou were a star until I served you like a bar and grill\nAs I proceed to cook and grill ya, that\u2019s all it took to kill ya\nYou better recognize me like I look familiar\nYou want to battle?

delirious, cause a curious... pause\nThe fury calls from my jaws from devouring y'all raw\n\n[Future (Mekhi Phifer)]\nYou forced to listen to the individual, the metaphysical\nThe Mac Mitten, rhyme ritual, heterosexual\nSyllables they sound complex to you, lines perplexing you\nWith words that could put a hex on you, snap that neck on you\nMurder you, boil you, we keep a white boy or two\nLet my man grab the mic, you see how Bunny Rabbit do\n\n[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]\nYour style is generic, mine's authentic made\nI roll like a renegade, you need clinic aid\nMy technique is bizarre and ill; I scar and kill\nYou were a star until I served you like a bar and grill\nAs I proceed to cook and grill ya, that\u2019s all it took to kill ya\nYou better recognize me like I look familiar\nYou want to battle?

you lost without a paddle, floating shit's creek\nYou ain't Detroit, I'm the D, you're the new kid on the block\n'Bout to get smacked back to the boondocks\nFucking Nazi, this crowd ain't your type\nTake some real advice and form a group with Vanilla Ice\nAnd what I tell you, you better use it\nThis guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music\nTrailer trash, I'll choke you to your last breath\nAnd have you looking foolish\nLike Cheddar Bob when he shot himself\nSilly Rabbit, I know why they call you that\n'Cause you follow Future like you got carrots up his ass crack\nAnd when you acting up that's when you got jacked up\nAnd left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up\nI'll crack your shoulder blade\nYou'll get dropped so hard that Elvis will start turning in his grave\nI don't know why they let you out in the dark\nYou need to take your white ass back across 8 Mile to the trailer park\n\n[B-Rabbit (Eminem)]\nThis guy raps like his parents jerked him\nHe sounds like Erick Sermon, the generic version\nThis whole crowd looks suspicious\nIt's all dudes in here, except for these bitches\nSo I'm a German, eh?\nThat's okay, you look like a fuckin' worm with braids\nThese Leaders of the Free World rookies\nLookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies\nTalkin' 'bout shits creek\nBitch, you could be up piss creek with paddles this deep\nYou're still gonna sink, you're a disgrace\nYeah, they call me Rabbit, this is a turtle race\nHe can't get with me, spitting this shit wickedly\nLickety shot suspicious spickety split lickety\nSo I'ma turn around with a great smile\nAnd walk my white ass back across 8 Mile"}}, {"title": "8 Mile: Marv Won vs B-Rabbit", "album": "8 Mile (Battles, Cyphers & Freestyles)", "year": "2002-09-08", "lyrics": "[Marv Won]\nYo, yo,

Bitch, you lucky I don't beat you up\nIn a game of fisticuffs, I'll push your face back\nYou can't fuck with me, man, really, just face facts\nIt's him versus me in a battle of ten rounds\nIt's like Muggsy Bogues tryin' to fuck with Jim Brown\nDumb fuck, I'm the type to run amok\nCome in the club drunk as fuck\nSlap your bitch so we can buck\nOne hook... type of a man the size of Dan Dierdorf\nTryin' to take his ear off, like Mike Tys\nI'm quite nice on fight nights\nAnd why he poppin' shit? Man, I thought he liked life\nApparently not, I'm incoherently hot\nAnd if I miss you then your parents get shot\nYo, I'm a bad boy, bitch, it's on\nI'll put 44's on your chest like you're Rick Mahorn\n\n[B-Rabbit]\nHold on, faggot, let me turn this mic on\nDon't think for a minute I'ma let you\nGet away with that song\n'Cause that shit was wack, you ain't spittin'\nAs a matter of fact, all of that shit was written\nAnd I know it wasn't for me\nSurely, you really must adore me\nNow, look it\u2026 yo, you might as well move  to Italy\nLook, this guy's ripped...*skkkrr* \u2013 literally\nYou don't wanna really fuck with this\nOn this microphone, I'm not Snuffleupagus\nBut I don't give a fuck, you can keep that dull rap\nAnd turn your ass back around with your fuckin' skullcap\nAnd your bandana or your motherfuckin' sweatband\nFuckin' with this style, you're a dead man\nI ain't Redman, but on this mic, yo, I pick it up\nJust like your face when I had to rip it up\nYou don't wanna see me, yo, uh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/8b0796f6920cbb54e1b8f5f4622ed422.768x768x1.jpg", "artist": "Eminem", "raw": {"annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/203925", "apple_music_id": null, "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/203925/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "This video wasn\u2019t filmed for the movie, it was a unscripted event, where the audience and hype guys were involved in a rap contest.

Y'all ready for death?\nMarv Won, the Fat Killer\nThe game done got ugly, let's go, yo, yo\nI seen your type before, you think you're tough\nBattle you? Bitch, you lucky I don't beat you up\nIn a game of fisticuffs, I'll push your face back\nYou can't fuck with me, man, really, just face facts\nIt's him versus me in a battle of ten rounds\nIt's like Muggsy Bogues tryin' to fuck with Jim Brown\nDumb fuck, I'm the type to run amok\nCome in the club drunk as fuck\nSlap your bitch so we can buck\nOne hook... type of a man the size of Dan Dierdorf\nTryin' to take his ear off, like Mike Tys\nI'm quite nice on fight nights\nAnd why he poppin' shit? Man, I thought he liked life\nApparently not, I'm incoherently hot\nAnd if I miss you then your parents get shot\nYo, I'm a bad boy, bitch, it's on\nI'll put 44's on your chest like you're Rick Mahorn\n\n[B-Rabbit]\nHold on, faggot, let me turn this mic on\nDon't think for a minute I'ma let you\nGet away with that song\n'Cause that shit was wack, you ain't spittin'\nAs a matter of fact, all of that shit was written\nAnd I know it wasn't for me\nSurely, you really must adore me\nNow, look it\u2026 yo, you might as well move  to Italy\nLook, this guy's ripped...*skkkrr* \u2013 literally\nYou don't wanna really fuck with this\nOn this microphone, I'm not Snuffleupagus\nBut I don't give a fuck, you can keep that dull rap\nAnd turn your ass back around with your fuckin' skullcap\nAnd your bandana or your motherfuckin' sweatband\nFuckin' with this style, you're a dead man\nI ain't Redman, but on this mic, yo, I pick it up\nJust like your face when I had to rip it up\nYou don't wanna see me, yo, uh"}}, {"title": "8 Mile: Maurice Grant vs B-Rabbit", "album": "8 Mile (Battles, Cyphers & Freestyles)", "year": "2002-11-08", "lyrics": "[Maurice Grant]\nThe

fucks\nRappin' away for food off this ragedy lunch truck\nWho want what? Who pumped up to get rolled up?\nI spit venom in every direction, soak some up\nLook at this fat-ass nigga, sloppy sucker\nYou're a ugly motherfucker, your pop should\u2019ve wore a rubber\nStop rhymin', keep your day job, Vanessa\nNext time leave that bullshit home on the dresser\nSpeaking of dresses, take a look at Paul the fruitcake\nWhen you travel you probably pack panties in your suitcase\nMade out of lace from Victoria\u2019s secret\nIf ten men came in a cup you\u2019d probably drink it\n\n[Jimmy (Eminem)]\nOkay, folks, enough with the gay jokes\nEspecially from a gay broke bitch yourself, hey lo'\nThis guy's a doo-doo\nYou've worked here longer than me\nAnd I get paid more than you do\nDawg, take a seat\nWhat\u2019s this guy standing in line for? He ain\u2019t got money to eat!\nCheck this out, yo yo\nThis guy cashed his whole check and bought one ho-ho\nFuckin' homo! Little maggot\nYou can\u2019t hack it; Paul\u2019s gay, you're a faggot\nAt least he admits it, don\u2019t even risk it\nThis guy's starvin' to death, someone get him a biscuit!\nI don\u2019t know what they told you, Mike\nYou must had them cornrows rolled too tight\nThis job, you wanna quit, but you can\u2019t\nYou\u2019ve worked at this plant so long, you're a plant\nLook at your goddamn boots!\nFor Christ sakes, they\u2019re starting to grow roots!\nOn this mic you get faded\nYou look like a pissed-off rapper who never made it\nAnd why you fuckin' with the gay guy, G?\nWhen really you're the one who's got the HIV\nMan, I\u2019m done with this clown, he's soft\nFuck it, I\u2019ll let homegirl finish you off\n\n[Vanessa (Miz-Korona)]\nA guy like you would never get a real

Dada must've runned over a skunk\nNow, I know what you're thinkin', it's kind of late to go swimmin'\nBut you know your Mama, she's one of those type of women\nThat do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit\nDon't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!)\nAnd don't look so upset, why you actin' bashful?\nDon't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle?

Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?\nHer make poo-poo ca-ca?

on London?\n\n[Pre-Performance Ad-Libs]\nOne two, one two\nOne two, one two, one two\nY'all done started something that you can't undo\nYo, yo\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI'm up in the spot with Tim Westwood\nYou wanna step to this? You better use your best foot\nFlawless freestyles I drop right off the top\nTake a bottle of beer and bite off the top\nRight of the block, straight to your neighbourhood\nThe flavor's good in London and I'ma stay for good\nYo, check it out, it's Slim Shady\nI rip the radio right off of the S baby\nY'all can't see me 'cause y'all don't wanna even be it\nY'all don't understand these freestyles when I MC it\nOriginal bad boy on the case, cover your face\nCame in the place, blowed and sprayed Puffy with mace\nI lace the weed with insect repellent, better check the smelly\nEminem starts with E, better check the spellin'\nWith a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple\nI got an aspirin capsule trapped on my Adam's apple\nSomebody dropped me on my head and I'm for sure\nThat my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her\nI slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was 6 months\nAnd said I'm ready now bitch, ain't you feeling these kicks, cunt?\nThe world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell\nI'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell\nI'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs\nAnd I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns\nI kick you in the tummy until you're sick to your stomach\nAnd vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it\nHit you in the head with a brick till you plummet\nIf y'all don't like me you can suck my dick till you numb it\nAnd all the gibberish you were spittin', you need to kill it\n'Cause your style is like dying in my sleep, I don't feel it\nAnd any MC that try to step to this I'll throw you right off of the roof\nAyo, bust it Proof!\n\n[Verse 2: Proof]\nOne of a kind and I come with the time\nHaving fun with the rhyme until I'm done with your mind\nListen, now every MC got a story\nWell mine is me and my story is an [?] before me\nI'm sorry [?] the style to be proved\nAyo since Big Daddy Kane fell off they don't know how to be smooth\nYo, I seen a fat rodent walk in with Paul Rosen\nWith a gat in holding, talking 'bout he DeShaun Holton\nIt's the same thing, we bust when it come through\nWith Tim Westwood, your best foot forward\nCan't do that, here it is, put your good foot\nWe mack y'all, like y'all was some hoes on Wood wood\nNo time for that, flatbacks when you rap, counterattack\nWith a battle axe, you collapse from them whack raps\nYou try to spit to me, I make you all know I'm a genius\nA [?]\nCome back holding my\u2015yo, no need to cuss, bust (penis!)\nYo we can't say that keep it the cleanest, the meanest\nSlim Shady, next thing it was my fault\nY'all caught outlined in chalk, incredible as the Hulk\nWhile I settle for [?], it's the P-R-letter O\nSex is hetero, cash more checks than federal, you better know\nHow you feel about they got a dope cheddar flow\nAnd my man Dee Teezy, straight from Stress magazine\nBag a scene, we drag your queen\nLike she's a man dressed up, how you feel you get pressed up\nLeft up, it's time for that P-R-O-O, you get F'd up\nYeah it's time for that mind combat\nNext up my man Slim Shade when we rhyme at\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nLast night I OD'd on rush, mushrooms and dust\nAnd rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed\nShucks, I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say\nI've called in to work cause all I do is frolic and play\nI swallow grenades and take about a bottle a day\nOf Tylenol 3 and talk about how violent I'll be\nGive me 11 Excedrin and my head will spin\nMedicine will get me reving like a 747 jet engine\nScratched my balls till I shred the skin\nDoctor check this rash, look how red it's been\nIt's probably AIDS, forget it then\nI'll strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows\nThat don't even make sense like dykes using dildos\nSo reach in your bill folds for 10 duckets\nAnd pick up the Slim Shady stuff that's on Rawkus\nSome'n some'n some'n some'n, I can't read it\nMy daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it\n\n[Verse 4: Proof]\nAyo, the truth hurt when Proof hurt\nMove the whole Earth beneath your feet just like loose dirt\nSo F your politics if you swallow, feel the hollow tips rip\nThrough your collar disc, learn your knowledges\nThen burn your colleges, I touch your grill\nWith the skill of a dermatologist, your turn to follow this\nAcknowledge this head cracker, ho smacker\nWhack rapper attacker, internet hacker\nNo slacker, best factor, Midwest bracket\nYeah you know about it, it's us on your jacket\nDJ Headscratcher like a hatchet, who can match it?\nMake you go-go like Gadget, perform magic\nWithout a wand, I drop bombs without Saddam\nA vet' without 'Nam, I make sense without common ground\nI'm still down y'all with my first crew\nYou got a fly style, I down that just like curfew\nYo I'm worth two ears and a mind full of attention\nPlus I'm CEO of the whack MC prevention\nListen to the real gift over ill riffs\nCause you on the mic, me and Em aren't tryna hear like Will Smith\nYour career's not over with, come here to

whole world\nSo go to hell and build a snowman, girl\nThe bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed\nThen they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me\n'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'\nWho coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?\nAnd while I'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar\nHigher than my opinion of these

can almost taste it\nI can almost taste it\n\n[Spoken: Eminem]\nCan't stop now\nThis might be the last chance I get to be famous\n(I just wanna be famous)\n\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]\nYou dream of trading places, I have been changing faces\nYou cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose\nWake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless\nThere is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes\nI just wanna be famous, but...\nBe careful what you wish for\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI stuck my dick in this game like a rapist\nThey call me Slim Roethlisberger\nI go berserker than a fed-up post office worker\nI murk her with a Mossberg, I'm pissed off, get murdered\nLike someone took a ketchup squirter, squirted a frankfurter\nFor a gangster, you sure did shit your pants\nWhen you saw the chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel\nHow thangs turn around when his fangs come out\nGet your brains blown out, that's what I call blowin' your mind\nWhen I come back, like nut on your spine\nI'm a thumb tack that you slept on, son\nNow here I come, screaming \"Attack!\" like I just stepped on one\nLow on the totem 'til he showed 'em defiance, giant scrotum\nHe don't owe them bitches shit, his britches, he outgrowed 'em\nHe's so out cold, he's knocked out at the South Pole\nAnd nobody fucks with him, rigor mortis and post mortem\nHe's dyin' of boredom\nTake your best rhymes, record 'em, then try to thwart him\nHe'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em\nShit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy\nWho licks the blades of his chainsaws\nWhile he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce?\nGame's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls\nYou think I'm backin' down?\nYou must be out of your dang skulls; I'm almost famous\n\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]\nYou dream of trading places, I have been changing faces\nYou cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose\nWake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless\nThere is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes\nI just wanna be famous, but...\nBe careful what you wish for\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nI'm back for revenge, I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again\nI'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen\nMetaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory\nSome I wrote on a napkin; I do what I have to to win\nPullin' out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's\nNot even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?\nAnd tell that psycho to pass the torch to the wacko\n'Fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern and smash it on his porch\nNow get off my dick! 'Dick''s too short of a word for my dick\nGet off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!\nDon't call me the Champ, call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer\nI just blew up the Challenger; matter fact, I need a lawyer\nI just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast\nBeat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer\nY'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Mes\nSee, he's in a whole nother weight class\nHe's slugs, you're BBs: you're bean-bag bullets\nYou're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's, laughed at Infinite\nNow he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties\nNo peace treaties, he's turned into a beast\nHis new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E\nHe's almost famous\n\n[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues & Eminem]\nYou dream of trading places, I have been changing faces\nYou cannot fill these shoes, there is too much to lose\nWake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless\nThere is too much to lose, you cannot fill these shoes\nI just wanna be famous, but...\nBe careful what you wish for\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nNow there he goes in Dre's studio, cuppin' his balls\nScreamin' the wood off the panelin', cussin' the paint off the walls\nSpewin' his hate to these haters, showin' no love for these broads\nHe ain't givin' them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard\nHe'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark\nWith the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out, \"Ahh!\"\nThese metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all\nIf they don't like it, they can all get fucked\nInstead of suckin' him off\nThey can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by\nLike David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die\nAnd eat shit while they at it, he's fuckin' had it\nHe's mad at the whole world\nSo go to hell and build a snowman, girl\nThe bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed\nThen they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me\n'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'\nWho coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it?\nAnd while I'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar\nHigher than my opinion of these women's been lowered\nSo bear witness to some biblical shit, there's a cold wind blowin'\nThis world ain't gonna know what hit it\nHe did it, he made it, he's finally famous"}}, {"title": "Amityville", "album": "The Marshall Mathers LP", "year": "2000-05-23", "lyrics": "[Intro: Eminem]\n(Kill, kill, kill)\nDahh-dum, dahh-dum... dum\nDahh-dum, dahh-dum, duh-da-da-da-da\n(Kill, kill, kill)\nDahh-dum, dahh-dum... dum\nDahh-dum, dahh-dum, dumm...\n(Kill, kill, kill)\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nMentally ill from Amityville (He'll)\nAccidentally kill your family still\nThinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)\nMentally ill from Amityville (He's)\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted\nFeet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick\nPen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit\nShrink, pencil me in for my last visit\nDrink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers\nHash, whiskey, and ash til I slap bitches\nAsk Bizzy, he's been here the past six years\nMash with me again and imagine this\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nMentally ill from Amityville (He'll)\nAccidentally kill your family still\nThinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)\nMentally ill from Amityville (He's)\n\n[Verse 2: Bizarre]\nI fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat\nGuess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope\nMy little sister's birthday, she'll remember me\nFor a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity\nAnd bitches know me as a horny-ass freak\nTheir mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was sleep\nPissy-drunk, throwing up in the urinal\n(You fucking homo!)

Detroit is sicker. He spits about evil acts and gruesome events that happen in the town.\n\nThe track was originally supposed to feature Outsidaz members Young Zee and Pacewon, but Dr. Dre complained that the album had too many features, which resulted in Eminem removing their verses and making the last one himself. Pacewon confirms this in an interview and adds that he believes that their verses have been permanently deleted\n\nThis resulted in a rift between Eminem and Pacewon specifically. The latter has released diss tracks aimed at Eminem since this episode."}, "comment_count": 1, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 3493019, "pinned": false,

kill)\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nMentally ill from Amityville (He'll)\nAccidentally kill your family still\nThinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)\nMentally ill from Amityville (He's)\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted\nFeet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick\nPen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit\nShrink, pencil me in for my last visit\nDrink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers\nHash, whiskey, and ash til I slap bitches\nAsk Bizzy, he's been here the past six years\nMash with me again and imagine this\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nMentally ill from Amityville (He'll)\nAccidentally kill your family still\nThinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)\nMentally ill from Amityville (He's)\n\n[Verse 2: Bizarre]\nI fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat\nGuess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope\nMy little sister's birthday, she'll remember me\nFor a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity\nAnd bitches know me as a horny-ass freak\nTheir mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was sleep\nPissy-drunk, throwing up in the urinal\n(You fucking homo!) That's what I said at my dad's funeral\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nMentally ill from Amityville (He'll)\nAccidentally kill your family still\nThinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)\nMentally ill from Amityville (He's)\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nThat's why the city is filled with a bunch of fucking idiots still\nThat's why the first mothafucka popping some shit he gets killed\nThat's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville\nYou can get capped after just having a cavity filled (hahahaha!)\nThat's why we're crowned the murder capital still\nThis ain't Detroit, this is motherfucking Hamburger Hill\nWe don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot\nAnd when the police come we fuckin shoot it out with 'em too\nThat's the mentality here, that's the reality here\nDid I just hear somebody say they want to challenge me here?\nWhile I'm holding a pistol with this many calibers here?\nPlus a registration that just made this shit valid this year?\n'Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions\nThat's when accidents happen, when a thousand bullets come at your house and collapse the foundation around you\nAnd they found you and your family in it\nGOD DAMMIT HE MEANT IT WHEN HE TELLS YOU\n\n[Hook: Eminem]\nMentally ill from Amityville (He'll)\nAccidentally kill your family still\nThinking he won't, goddammit he will (He's)\nMentally ill from Amityville (He's)\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nDum, tahh-dum... ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum... ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum... ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum... ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum... ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum... ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum... ta-dah-da\nDum, tahh-dum... ta-dah-da\nDum..."}}, {"title": "Anger Management", "album": "Anger Management 3", "year": "2005-06-28", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nAlright, let's go\nYeah!

Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face\nCame in the place, blowed, and sprayed Puffy with mace\nI laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly\nEminem starts with E, better check the spellin'\nWith a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple\nI got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple\nSomebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure\nThat my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her\nI slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months\nAnd said \"I'm ready now, bitch! Ain't you feelin' these kicks, cunt?\"\nThe world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell\nI'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in Hell\nI'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs\nAnd I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns\nI kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach\nAnd vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it\nHit you in the head with a brick 'til you plummet\nIf y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick 'til you numb it\nAnd all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it\n\u2018Cause your style is like dying in my sleep; I don't feel it\n\n[Hook]\n\u2018Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan\nFor twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin\nIs fuckin' crazy \u2013 you hear me?

I'm an alcoholic, and that's all I can say\nI call in at work, \u2018cause all I do is frolic and play\nI swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day\nOf Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)\nGive me eleven Excedrin, my head'll spin\nMedicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine\nScratched my balls 'til I shred the skin\n\"Doctor, check this rash! Look how red it's been!\"\n\"It's probably AIDS!\" \"Forget it then.\"\nI strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows\nThat don't even make sense, like dykes using dildos\nSo reach in your billfolds for ten ducats\nAnd pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus\n\"Somethin', somethin', somethin', somethin', I get weeded.\"\nMy daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it\n\n[Hook]\n\u2018Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan\nFor twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin\nIs fuckin' crazy \u2013 you hear me?

Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face\nCame in the place, blowed, and sprayed Puffy with mace\nI laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly\nEminem starts with E, better check the spellin'\nWith a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple\nI got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple\nSomebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure\nThat my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her\nI slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months\nAnd said \"I'm ready now, bitch! Ain't you feelin' these kicks, cunt?\"\nThe world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell\nI'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in Hell\nI'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs\nAnd I'm hotter than my dick is when I piss and it burns\nI kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach\nAnd vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it\nHit you in the head with a brick 'til you plummet\nIf y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick 'til you numb it\nAnd all that gibberish you was spittin', you need to kill it\n\u2018Cause your style is like dying in my sleep; I don't feel it\n\n[Hook]\n\u2018Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan\nFor twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin\nIs fuckin' crazy \u2013 you hear me? Huh?\nIs fuckin' crazy \u2013 hello, hi!\n\u2018Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan\nFor twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin\nIs fuckin' crazy \u2013 do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm ice-grillin' you, starin' you down with a gremlin grin\nI'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym\nI'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias\nTo save me with in case I get chased by space aliens\nA brainiac, with a cranium packed\nFull of more uranium than a maniac Saudi Arabian\nA highly combustible head\nSpasmatic, strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed\nLaid up in the hospital in critical condition\nI flatlined, jumped up, and ran from the mortician\nHigh speed, IV full of Thai weed\nLookin' Chinese with my knees stuck together like Siamese\nTwins, joined at the groin like lesbians\nUhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins\nI hope God forgives me for my sins\nIt probably all depends on if I keep on killin' my girlfriends\n\n[Hook]\n\u2018Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan\nFor twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills, and a minithin\nIs fuckin' crazy \u2013 you hear me? Ha?\nIs fuckin' crazy \u2013 hello, hi!\n\u2018Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan\nFor twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin\nIs fuckin' crazy \u2013 do you hear me? Is fuckin' crazy\n\n[Verse 3]\nLast night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust\nAnd got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed\n(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic, and that's all I can say\nI call in at work, \u2018cause all I do is frolic and play\nI swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day\nOf Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)\nGive me eleven Excedrin, my head'll spin\nMedicine'll get me revvin' like a 747 jet engine\nScratched my balls 'til I shred the skin\n\"Doctor, check this rash!

say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning\nBeen flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess\nIt's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me\nAnd it's your birthday, Jade, I'm

permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud\nYou put your arm around Momma to calm her, wow\nI just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down\nNever see you graduate in your caps and gowns\nIt's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?\nI've got so much more to do\nAnd, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two\nThe thought of no more me and you\nYou

constantly be reminded\nBy pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause\nThat image burned in my brain of you on that table\nMe falling across your body, not able to stand to save you\nGod, why did you take him?\nI'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?\nLittle ladies, be brave, take care of your mother\nSmile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other\nI'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory\nAnd I know you'll never forget me\nJust don't get sad when remembering\nAnd, little bro, keep making me proud\nYou better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down\nAnd when you're exchanging those sacred vows\nJust know that if I could be there, I would\nAnd should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it\nOh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too\nI actually learned a lot from you\nYou taught me what not to do\nAnd, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance\nTo have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you\nDoody, I see you, I go to walk to you\nAnd I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room\nNurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out\nThen the sheet over my head, shut the room down\nGirls, please don't get upset\nI see them cheeks soaking and wet\nAs you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let\nMe go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks\nWith every second, each closer to death\nBut suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow\nThen a breath, machines go (*beep beep beep*)\nMust've guessed the cheat codes to this shit\nI'm tryna rewind time like a tape\nFind an escape, make a beeline, try and awake\nFrom this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength\nTo remind me, even if a steep climb I must take\nTo rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape\n\n[Part II: Castle Extended]\n\n(I don't want it!)\nI'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it\nOne hundred percent finished, fed up with it\nI'm hanging it up, fuck it!\nExcuse the cursing, baby, but just know\nThat I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold\nAnd if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't\nI'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet\nShred these old letters I wrote\nAll that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll\nI'm proud to be back\nI'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse\nWith Recovery, Mathers LP2\nHelp propel me to victory laps\nGas toward 'em and fast forward the past\nConsider them last four minutes as\nThe song I'da sang to my daughters\nIf I'da made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later, but I fought it\nAnd came back like a boomerang on 'em\nNow a new day is dawnin'\nI'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin'\u2014now I know\n\nToilet flush", "image":

"lyrics": "[Part I: Arose]\n\nIf I could rewind time like a tape\nInside a boombox, one day for every pill or Percocet that I ate\nCut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything\nBut death is turning so definite\u2014wait!\nThey got me all hooked up to some machine\nI love you, Bean, didn't want you to know I was struggling\nFeels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine\nJust heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning\nBeen flirtatious with death, skirt-chasing, I guess\nIt's arrivederci, same nurse, just heard say they're unplugging me\nAnd it's your birthday, Jade, I'm missing your birthday\nBaby girl, I'm sorry, I fucking hate when you hurt, Hai\nAnd sweeties, thank you for waiting to open gifts\nBut, girls, you can just open 'em\nDad ain't making it home for Christmas\nWish I had the strength to just blow a kiss\nI go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff\nI yell, but nothing comes out, I'm crying inside, I shout\nMy vocal cords won't permit me, I scream, but it's not aloud\nYou put your arm around Momma to calm her, wow\nI just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk us down\nNever see you graduate in your caps and gowns\nIt's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happening now?\nI've got so much more to do\nAnd, Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down, but this tore me in two\nThe thought of no more me and you\nYou gave me shoes, Nikes like new for me for school\nDoody, I'm trying, but you, you were the glue that binded\nSo many things\u2014time, I'd give anything to rewind it\nI had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded\nBy pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night 'cause\nThat image burned in my brain of you on that table\nMe falling across your body, not able to stand to save you\nGod, why did you take him?\nI'm tryna keep his legacy alive, but I'm dying, where's Nathan?\nLittle ladies, be brave, take care of your mother\nSmile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other\nI'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory\nAnd I know you'll never forget me\nJust don't get sad when remembering\nAnd, little bro, keep making me proud\nYou better marry that girl 'cause she's faithfully down\nAnd when you're exchanging those sacred vows\nJust know that if I could be there, I would\nAnd should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it\nOh, almost forgot to do something, thank my father too\nI actually learned a lot from you\nYou taught me what not to do\nAnd, Mom, wish I'd have had the chance\nTo have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you\nDoody, I see you, I go to walk to you\nAnd I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room\nNurses lean over the bed, pulling tubes out\nThen the sheet over my head, shut the room down\nGirls, please don't get upset\nI see them cheeks soaking and wet\nAs you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly, don't wanna let\nMe go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks\nWith every second, each closer to death\nBut suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow\nThen a breath, machines go (*beep beep beep*)\nMust've guessed the cheat codes to this shit\nI'm tryna rewind time like a tape\nFind an escape, make a beeline, try and awake\nFrom this dream, I need to re-find my inner strength\nTo remind me, even if a steep climb I must take\nTo rewrite a mistake, I'm rewinding the tape\n\n[Part II: Castle Extended]\n\n(I don't want it!)\nI'll put out this last album, then I'm done with it\nOne hundred percent finished, fed up with it\nI'm hanging it up, fuck it!\nExcuse the cursing, baby, but just know\nThat I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold\nAnd if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't\nI'm pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet\nShred these old letters I wrote\nAll that old pathetic loathing, closing credits can roll\nI'm proud to be back\nI'm 'bout to, like a rematch, outdo Relapse\nWith Recovery, Mathers LP2\nHelp propel me to victory laps\nGas toward 'em and fast forward the past\nConsider them last four minutes as\nThe song I'da sang to my daughters\nIf I'da made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later, but I fought it\nAnd came back like a boomerang on 'em\nNow a new day is dawnin'\nI'm up, Tuesday, it's mornin'\u2014now I know\n\nToilet flush"}}, {"title": "Asshole", "album": "The Marshall Mathers LP 2",

How do fuckin' magnets work?\"\n\u2018Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable\nHate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical\nI'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical\nThinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical\nYou crackin' a joke, it's laughable\n\u2018Cause me and love's like a bad combination\nI keep them feelings locked in a vault\nSo it's safe to say I'm uncrackable\nMy heart is truly guarded, full body armor\nBitch, you just need a helmet\n\u2018Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded\nThinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina\nYou're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind\nShorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er\n\u2018Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor\nBeen tryna hunt me down like a dog\n\u2018Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent\n\u2018Cause all of my spare time is spent\nOn my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'\nOnly women that I love are my daughters\nBut sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father\nAnd I push it farther\nSo, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line\nIt's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent\nI'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents\nAnd motherfuckin' Father Time\nIt ain't never gonna stop a pessimist\nWho transformed to an optimist in his prime\nSo even if I'm half-dead, I'm half alive\nPoured my half empty glass in a cup\nSo now my cup has runneth over\nAnd I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster\nI\u2019m going back to what got me here\nYeah, cocky, and can\u2019t knock being rude off, so fear not, my dear\nAnd dry up your teardrops, I'm here\nWhite America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird\nIf you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too\nShouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows\n\n[Hook: Skylar Grey]\nEverybody knows that you're just an asshole\nEverywhere that you go\nPeople wanna go home, everyone knows\nEverybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice\nThere's no place you can hide\nYou are just an asshole\nEveryone knows, everyone knows", "image": "https://images.genius.com/2c354260f9edc6b2e9bf6b06c935a0b8.1000x1000x1.png", "artist": "Eminem", "raw": {"annotation_count": 85, "api_path": "/songs/235728", "apple_music_id": "731756773", "apple_music_player_url": "https://genius.com/songs/235728/apple_music_player", "description": {"plain": "With Em\u2019s lyrical complexity at an all time high, he spits, as the title may suggest, like an asshole.

asshole, that role I think I succeeded fulfillin'\nBut don't think I ever stopped\nTo think that I was speaking to children\nEverything was happening so fast\nIt was like I blinked\u2014sold three million\nThen it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous\n\u2018Cause I was getting sick of this feelin'\nLike I am always under attack, man\nI could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin'\nWomen dishin' but really thinking: \"If anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him.\"\nGuess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin' shit\nBut since when did this many people ever give a shit\nWhat I had to say? It's just my opinion\nIf it contradicts how I'm livin', put a dick in your rear end\nThat's why every time you mentioned a lyric\nI thanked you for it, for drawing more attention toward it\n\u2018Cause it gave me an enormous platform\nI'm flattered you thought I was that important\nBut you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect\nAnd battled for it, mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed\nAtta-boy, they told me to slow down, and I just zoned out\nGood luck tryin' to convince a blonde\nIt's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out\n\u2018Cause I was tryin' to leave, no doubt\nIn anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history\nThink they know now, because everybody knows\n\n[Hook: Skylar Grey]\nEverybody knows that you're just an asshole\nEverywhere that you go\nPeople wanna go home, everyone knows\nEverybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice\nThere's no place you can hide\nYou are just an asshole\nEveryone knows, everyone knows\n\n[Interlude: Eminem]\nThanks for the support, asshole! *scratch*\nThanks for the support, asshole!\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nQuit actin' salty! I was countin' on you to count me out\nAsk Asher Roth when he round about\nDissed me to shout me out\nThought I was history, but goddamn, honky\nThat compliment's like backhanding a donkey\nGood way to get your ass socked in the mouth\nNah, I'm off him\nBut what the fuck is all this trash-talkin' about?\nThe fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me\nYou knocked me down, I went down for the count\nI fell, but the fans caught me, and now\nYou're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me\nTo take my belt\u2014word to Pacquiao\nMomma said there ain't nothin' else to talk about\nBetter go in that ring and knock 'em out\nOr you better not come out\nIt's poetry in motion\nLike Freddie Roach when he's quotin' Shakespeare\nSo what if the insults are revoltin'?\nEven Helen Keller knows life stinks\nYou think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled\nBut you should give little shit what I think\nThis whole world is a mess\nGotta have a goddamn vest on your chest\nAnd a Glock just to go watch Batman\nWho needs to test a testicles? Not that man\nHalf of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage\nRest of you got lap bands\nStuck to this motto before they put bath salts\nAnd all those water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo!\nMy soul's escapin' through this asshole that is gapin'\nA black hole, and I'm swallowin' this track whole\nBetter pack toilet paper, but I'm taking no crap, ho\nHere I go down the Bat Pole\nAnd I'm changing back into that old maniac\nIn fact there they go tryin' to dip out the back-door retreatin'\n\u2018Cause everybody knows\n\n[Hook: Skylar Grey]\nEverybody knows that you're just an asshole\nEverywhere that you go\nPeople wanna go home, everyone knows\nEverybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice\nThere's no place you can hide\nYou are just an asshole\nEveryone knows, everyone knows\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nHoly mackerel! I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth\nI smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull\nFor thinkin' we had some magnetic pull\nThen screamed \"ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin' magnets work?\"\n\u2018Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable\nHate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical\nI'm making up words you can understandable, it's tragical\nThinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical\nYou crackin' a joke, it's laughable\n\u2018Cause me and love's like a bad combination\nI keep them feelings locked in a vault\nSo it's safe to say I'm uncrackable\nMy heart is truly guarded, full body armor\nBitch, you just need a helmet\n\u2018Cause if you think you're special, you're retarded\nThinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina\nYou're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind\nShorty, you're fine, but you sort of remind me of a 49er\n\u2018Cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor\nBeen tryna hunt me down like a dog\n\u2018Cause you're on my ass but you can't get a cent\n\u2018Cause all of my spare time is spent\nOn my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'\nOnly women that I love are my daughters\nBut sometimes I rhyme and it sounds like I forget I'm a father\nAnd I push it farther\nSo, Father, forgive me if I forget to draw the line\nIt's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent\nI'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents\nAnd motherfuckin' Father Time\nIt ain't never gonna stop a pessimist\nWho transformed to an optimist in his prime\nSo even if I'm half-dead, I'm half alive\nPoured my half empty glass in a cup\nSo now my cup has runneth over\nAnd I'm 'bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin' coaster\nI\u2019m going back to what got me here\nYeah, cocky, and can\u2019t knock being rude off, so fear not, my dear\nAnd dry up your teardrops, I'm here\nWhite America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird\nIf you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too\nShouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows\n\n[Hook: Skylar Grey]\nEverybody knows that you're just an asshole\nEverywhere that you go\nPeople wanna go home, everyone knows\nEverybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice\nThere's no place you can hide\nYou are just an asshole\nEveryone knows, everyone knows"}}, {"title": "Ass Like That", "album": "Encore", "year": "2005-06-07", "lyrics": "[Intro]\nWow, baby\n\n[Chorus]\nThe way you shake it, I can't believe it\nI ain't never seen an ass like that\nThe way you move it, you make my pee-pee go\nD-doing, doing, doing\nI don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true\nI ain't never seen an ass like that\nThe way you move it, you make my pee-pee go\nD-doing, doing, doing\n\n[Verse 1]\nThe way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer\nShe's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I\nThink someone's at the door but I don't think I'ma answer\nPolice saying \"freeze\" (oh!), d-doing, doing, doing\nWhat do you mean, \"freeze\"?

it would stop and let me off right now\n\n[Interlude/Collision]\nYes, man! As the world turns\nWe all experience things in life\nTrials and tribulations that we all must go through\nWhen someone wants to test us\nWhen someone tries our patience\n\n[Verse 1]\nI hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters\nWho swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns\nOutsidaz, baby, and we suin' the courts\n\u2018Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source\nThey never should've booted me outta reform school\nDeformed fool, taking a shit in the warm pool\n'Til they threw me out the Ramada Inn\nI said it wasn't me, I got a twin\n(Oh my God, it's you! Not again!)\nIt all started when my mother took my bike away\n\u2018Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave\nAfter that, it was straight to the 40 ouncers\nSlappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors\nClass clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman\nFuck the next lesson! I'll pass the test guessin'\nAnd all the other kids said: \"Eminem is a thizz head\nHe'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is phys-ed.\"\nMaybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class\nThat she was too fat to swim laps, she need a Slim Fast\n(Who? Me?) Yeah, bitch, you so big\nYou walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig\nShe picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig\nPut me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig\nI felt the evilness and started transformin'\nIt began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarmin'\nGrabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground\nAnd took her up to the highest diving board 'n' tossed her down\nSorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop\nWhile I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly-flop\n\n[Hook]\nI don't know why this world keeps turning round and round\nBut I wish it would stop and let me off right now\n\n[Interlude/Collision]\nAs the world turns, these are the days of our lives\nThese are the things that we must go through, day by day\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe drive around in million dollar sports cars\nWhile little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards\nOutsidaz, and we suin' the courts\n\u2018Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source (Yo!)\nHypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat\nWhere all the raunchy, fat, white, trashy blondes be at\nDressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage\nIt's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch\nI met a slut and said: \"What up? It's nice to meet ya\nI'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza\nBut I'm broke as fuck\nAnd I don't get paid 'til the first of next month\nBut if you would care to join me I was 'bout to roll this next blunt\nBut I ain't got no weed, no Phillies or no papers\nPlus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist\nSo give me all your money and don't try nothing funny\n\u2018Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me.\"\nI went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me\nWith an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry\nI fell through the glass doors, started causing a scene\nSlid across the floor and flew right into a washing machine\nJumped up with a broken back, thank God I was smokin' crack\nAll day, and doped up on coke and smack\nAll I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse\nNow I wanna kill her, but yo, I gotta catch her first\nRan through Rally's parking lot and took a shortcut\nSaw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up\nKicked the door down to murder this divorced slut\nLooked around the room, that's when I seen her bedroom door shut\n\"I know you're in there, bitch, I got my gun cocked\nYou might as well come out now\"\nShe said: \"Come in! It's unlocked.\"\nI walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne\nAnd seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn\nShe said: \"Come here, big boy! Let's get acquainted!\"\nI turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it\nShe came at me at full speed, nothin' could stop her\nI shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her\nI started to beg: \"No, please let go!\"\nBut she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll\nWith one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled\nI grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple\nJust tryna buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick\nDuh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick!\nWhipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it\nIt hit the ground, caused an earthquake and power outage\nI shouted: \"Now, bitch, let's see who gets the best!\"\nStuffed that shit in, crooked and fucked that fat slut to death\n(Come here, bitch, come here!\nTake this mothafuckin' dick, bitch, come here!)\n\n[Hook]\nI don't know why this world keeps turning round and round\nBut I wish it would stop and let me off right now\nI don't know why this world keeps turning round and round\nBut I wish it would stop and let me off right now\nI don't know why this world keeps turning round and round\nBut I wish it would stop and let me off right now\n\n[Interlude/Collision]\nAnd as we go along, throughout the days of our lives\nWe all face small obstacles and challenges everyday\nThat we must go through, these are the things\nThat surround us through our atmosphere, every day\nEvery single day the world keeps turning\nKeeps turning, keeps turning"}}, {"title": "Baby", "album": "The Marshall Mathers LP 2", "year": "2013-11-05", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nOne thousand different houses and M\u00fcnchausen\nI'ma make you wanna punch out some-fuckin'-one: \"Ouch!\nWhat the fuck you hit me for?!\"\nScream \"life\" as I punch counter, in bunches out of anger\nI once encountered a stranger in a dumb gown\nBlack hood with a scythe, shit, I'll laugh in his face, spit\nBitch gave me an extra life, like, \"Take this!\nNow get your ass back in that game, bitch!\nDon't take shit for granted, and don't take shit\nGive it!\" \u2014 only bull you should take is by the horns\nA mixture of Whitey Ford and Mighty Thor\nI everlast, pen is mightier than sword\nFinish writin', then record, replenish, keep writin' more\nNothing's ridin' on it but your pride, that's all you're fightin' for\nSo you bite, scratch, you claw, backs to wall\nNo one was there to catch you fall\nYou pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off\nYou grab your balls like they're gargantuan\nAnd ask yourself how fuckin' bad you want it\nPull out your pass for whoopin' ass and flash it on 'em\nNobody's gonna back you in that corner, you're a hornet\nNo one's more ignorant than you fuckin' four in the mornin'\nYou're at the la-bor-atory\nStormin' like there's nothin' that's more important\nEmcees, you better consider this a formal warnin', you're in for it!\nGirl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain\nAnd I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?\nI ain't finished, bitch, I meant in half, oil the blades\nNobody wants to play, they say I'm a spoiled lil' baby, but\u2014\n\n[Hook]\nNobody puts a baby in the corner\nI'm only tryna warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum\nHe'll fuckin' flip on ya\n'Cause nobody puts a baby in the corner\nI'm only tryna warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum\nHe'll fuckin' flip on ya\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat goes through an addict's brain\nBesides static pain and Big Daddy Kane\nBreakbeats and words?

(chicka) GOAT\nNow fling that bitch from your fingertips\nHope it lands on another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit\nAnything of wit that's interesting to spit\nYo, who's king of this fuckin' English lit?\nLet your middle fingers flip on each hand while extending this shit\nHow low can you go?\nLower then Chuck D, ho, hear the bassiness\nIn my voice? Rocky's back, where's my Adrians?\nNobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius\nI'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots to rap\nI'm not a man, I'm a weapon\nWho just happened to be a rapper\nWho just happen to be on the crapper\nWhen it happened I had an epiphany in the bathroom\nI'd never be the same after\nNow I'm back with an appe-tite for destruction\nAnd a fuckin' recipe for

undivided attention\nBut be reminded: if I didn't mention\nI lose my mind and my temper\nYou'd be the first one who finds him offensive\nGot him climbin' the fences\nLost some time to addiction\nBut look up rhyme in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture\nEminem is the synonym for it, I'm an enigma\nFuck it, let's get to the meatballs, I'm gonna skip the\nVeg and potatoes, edumacator\nThey are shit, legends are made of spit, treacherous data\nShit that you would say to your worst enemy\nThis wretched is what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada\nThen combine 'em with Method Man and Redman\nWith metham-phetamines in his left hand\nIn his right is a sledgehammer\nIn pajamas, standin' in front of a webcam\nBeatin' himself in the head 'til Russell lets him off Def Jam\nMaybe I need my head examined\nHannibal Lecter with a dead lamb\nHangin' from his ceiling, drippin' with a bed pan\nI need meds, swear to God\n'Cause if I go off the edge, T.I. ain't talkin' me off the ledge\nMan, heart-throb, better fart, ah\nNah, more like a smart slob\nPart Blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject to the heart\nAnd leave claw marks all over the Wal-Mart walls\nLittle baby with large balls\nFuck mud-slingin', I'm blood-flingin'\nThere's nothing on this fucking Earth\nBetter than bein' the king of the playground\nI hate the swings, but I love bein' an underdog\n'Cause when I'm pushed I end up swingin' (Ah!)\n\n[Hook]\nNobody puts a baby in the corner\nI'm only tryna warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum\nHe'll fuckin' flip on ya\n'Cause nobody

scythe, shit, I'll laugh in his face, spit\nBitch gave me an extra life, like, \"Take this!\nNow get your ass back in that game, bitch!\nDon't take shit for granted, and don't take shit\nGive it!\" \u2014 only bull you should take is by the horns\nA mixture of Whitey Ford and Mighty Thor\nI everlast, pen is mightier than sword\nFinish writin', then record, replenish, keep writin' more\nNothing's ridin' on it but your pride, that's all you're fightin' for\nSo you bite, scratch, you claw, backs to wall\nNo one was there to catch you fall\nYou pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off\nYou grab your balls like they're gargantuan\nAnd ask yourself how fuckin' bad you want it\nPull out your pass for whoopin' ass and flash it on 'em\nNobody's gonna back you in that corner, you're a hornet\nNo one's more ignorant than you fuckin' four in the mornin'\nYou're at the la-bor-atory\nStormin' like there's nothin' that's more important\nEmcees, you better consider this a formal warnin', you're in for it!\nGirl, what would you do if I said your body was off the chain\nAnd I told you I smile every single time I saw your face?\nI ain't finished, bitch, I meant in half, oil the blades\nNobody wants to play, they say I'm a spoiled lil' baby, but\u2014\n\n[Hook]\nNobody puts a baby in the corner\nI'm only tryna warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum\nHe'll fuckin' flip on ya\n'Cause nobody puts a baby in the corner\nI'm only tryna warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum\nHe'll fuckin' flip on ya\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhat goes through an addict's brain\nBesides static pain and Big Daddy Kane\nBreakbeats and words? An erratic train\nOf thought like splatter paint, scatter brain\nYeah, maybe that explains\nWhy you're back but you don't rap the same\nAnd you're lookin' way thinner\n'Cause your hunger got you lookin' like they took away dinner\n(Chicka) \"Sugar Ray\" Leonard\nWouldn't sugar-coat a fuckin' booger though\nJust to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat\nWhen you say you're a (chicka) what? (chicka) GOAT\nNow fling that bitch from your fingertips\nHope it lands on another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit\nAnything of wit that's interesting to spit\nYo, who's king of this fuckin' English lit?\nLet your middle fingers flip on each hand while extending this shit\nHow low can you go?\nLower then Chuck D, ho, hear the bassiness\nIn my voice? Rocky's back, where's my Adrians?\nNobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius\nI'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots to rap\nI'm not a man, I'm a weapon\nWho just happened to be a rapper\nWho just happen to be on the crapper\nWhen it happened I had an epiphany in the bathroom\nI'd never be the same after\nNow I'm back with an appe-tite for destruction\nAnd a fuckin' recipe for disaster\nSo let's eat 'cause I'm famished\nEvery deed is a dastardly one\nEvilish bastard, even you askin' for me to be po-lite\nTo people's like me havin' my teeth pulled\n\n[Hook]\nNobody puts a baby in the corner\nI'm only tryna warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum\nHe'll fuckin' flip on ya\n'Cause nobody puts a baby in the corner\nI'm only tryna warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum\nHe'll fuckin' flip on ya\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo step inside a dimension\nDemented side of a mind that's like an inside of an engine\nWhile I multiply your undivided attention\nBut be reminded: if I didn't mention\nI lose my mind and my temper\nYou'd be the first one who finds him offensive\nGot him climbin' the fences\nLost some time to addiction\nBut look up rhyme in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture\nEminem is the synonym for it, I'm an enigma\nFuck it, let's get to the meatballs, I'm gonna skip the\nVeg and potatoes, edumacator\nThey are shit, legends are made of spit, treacherous data\nShit that you would say to your worst enemy\nThis wretched is what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada\nThen combine 'em with Method Man and Redman\nWith metham-phetamines in his left hand\nIn his right is a sledgehammer\nIn pajamas, standin' in front of a webcam\nBeatin' himself in the head 'til Russell lets him off Def Jam\nMaybe I need my head examined\nHannibal Lecter with a dead lamb\nHangin' from his ceiling, drippin' with a bed pan\nI need meds, swear to God\n'Cause if I go off the edge, T.I. ain't talkin' me off the ledge\nMan, heart-throb, better fart, ah\nNah, more like a smart slob\nPart Blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob-ject to the heart\nAnd leave claw marks all over the Wal-Mart walls\nLittle baby with large balls\nFuck mud-slingin', I'm blood-flingin'\nThere's nothing on this fucking Earth\nBetter than bein' the king of the playground\nI hate the swings, but I love bein' an underdog\n'Cause when I'm pushed I end up swingin' (Ah!)\n\n[Hook]\nNobody puts a baby in the corner\nI'm only tryna warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum\nHe'll fuckin' flip on ya\n'Cause nobody puts a baby in the corner\nI'm only tryna warn ya\n'Cause that baby gets mad and gets to throwin' a tantrum\nHe'll fuckin' flip on ya"}}, {"title": "Backstabber", "album": "Infinite", "year": "1996-11-12", "lyrics": "[Intro: Police Scanner]\nAttention all units, attention all units\nWe have an all-points bulletin out on a man with green hair\nI repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair\nHe's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife\nProceed with caution, watch your back, fellas\nHe could be coming at your girlfriend next\n\n[Verse 1]\nThere's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward\nHis face is up on the bulletin board with a reward\nHe'll stab you with a sword, don't be fooled by his charm\nHe's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm\nRing the alarm, look for a man with green hair\nCheck at your girl's house, he was last seen there\nHe's has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes\nGood luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks\n\n[Hook]\nCome here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood\nHaha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain\u2019t no good!\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed\nSuited up head to toe in detective uniforms\nOur unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors\nLockin' down every block and put up metal detectors\nProtect yours and be sure that you stand close\nWatch each other's backs and guard your command post\nAnd most of all be advised that he's wise\nHe could be disguised as one of your very own guys\n\n[Hook]\nCome here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood\nHaha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain\u2019t no good!\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm on a solo mission to find him personally\nTo settle the score and to beat him unmercifully\nFor what he first did to me, it's sure to be the last\nFollowin' footprints with a magnifyin' glass\nTo drag his lyin' ass back to his padded cell\nI'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail\nI heard a yell, the voice sounded familiar\n\"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya!\"\n\n[Hook]\nCome here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood\nHaha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain\u2019t no good!\n\n[Verse 4]\nI followed the voice that led down a flight of steps\nSneezin' at dust, and swingin' at the spider webs\nInside the depths of his basement\nI taste lint, in my mouth\nThen the lights in the place went\nI saw my life flash in front of my eyes\nI felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs\nNone of my guys knew where I'm at, I was doomed\nThen I remembered the flashlight in my costume\n\n[Hook]\nCome here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood\nHaha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain\u2019t no good!\n\n[Verse 5]\nDealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned\nThey're only powerful when you got your back turned\nI yearned for the day that we finally met again\nSo I can give him a taste of his own medicine\nHe shed his skin, then he promised to come clean\nI took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen\nCuffed him at the scene, then dragged the fella home\nBeating him over the head with the telephone\n\n[Police Voice]\nAttention all cars, attention all cars\nUnit 313 has apprehended the suspect\nHe's going back to the crazy home\nI repeat, he's going back to the crazy home\nJob well done\n\n[Hook]\nCome here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood\nHaha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain\u2019t no good!", "image": "https://images.genius.com/eda31ba0169a98076608e99c8f5f8ef7.590x590x1.jpg", "artist": "Eminem", "raw":

"lyrics": "[Intro: Police Scanner]\nAttention all units, attention all units\nWe have an all-points bulletin out on a man with green hair\nI repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair\nHe's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife\nProceed with caution, watch your back, fellas\nHe could be coming at your girlfriend next\n\n[Verse 1]\nThere's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward\nHis face is up on the bulletin board with a reward\nHe'll stab you with a sword, don't be fooled by his charm\nHe's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm\nRing the alarm, look for a man with green hair\nCheck at your girl's house, he was last seen there\nHe's has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes\nGood luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks\n\n[Hook]\nCome here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood\nHaha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain\u2019t no good!\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed\nSuited up head to toe in detective uniforms\nOur unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors\nLockin' down every block and put up metal detectors\nProtect yours and be sure that you stand close\nWatch each other's backs and guard your command post\nAnd most of all be advised that he's wise\nHe could be disguised as one of your very own guys\n\n[Hook]\nCome here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood\nHaha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain\u2019t no good!\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm on a solo mission to find him personally\nTo settle the score and to beat him unmercifully\nFor what he first did to me, it's sure to be the last\nFollowin' footprints with a magnifyin' glass\nTo drag his lyin' ass back to his padded cell\nI'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail\nI heard a yell, the voice sounded familiar\n\"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya!\"\n\n[Hook]\nCome here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood\nHaha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain\u2019t no good!\n\n[Verse 4]\nI followed the voice that led down a flight of steps\nSneezin' at dust, and swingin' at the spider webs\nInside the depths of his basement\nI taste lint, in my mouth\nThen the lights in the place went\nI saw my life flash in front of my eyes\nI felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs\nNone of my guys knew where I'm at, I was doomed\nThen I remembered the flashlight in my costume\n\n[Hook]\nCome here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood\nHaha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain\u2019t no good!\n\n[Verse 5]\nDealing with backstabbers, there was one thing I learned\nThey're only powerful when you got your back turned\nI yearned for the day that we finally met again\nSo I can give him a taste of his own medicine\nHe shed his skin, then he promised to come clean\nI took his butcher knife and jabbed it into his spleen\nCuffed him at the scene, then dragged the fella home\nBeating him over the head with the telephone\n\n[Police Voice]\nAttention all cars, attention all cars\nUnit 313 has apprehended the suspect\nHe's going back to the crazy home\nI repeat, he's going back to the crazy home\nJob well done\n\n[Hook]\nCome here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood\nHaha, come here, you fuckin' backstabber!\n(Why I oughta) stay away from him, he ain\u2019t no good!"}}, {"title": "Bad Guy", "album": "The Marshall Mathers LP 2", "year": "2013-11-05", "lyrics": "Part 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes\n\n[Verse 1]\nIt's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt\nTried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work\nAll it takes is one song on the radio, you're\nRight back on it, reminding me all over again\nHow you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt\nSpent a lot of time tryin' to soul search\nMaybe I needed to grow up a little first\nWell, looks like I hit a growth spurt\nBut I'm coming for closure\nDon't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for\nThe way that you turned your back on me\nJust when I may have needed you most\nOh, you thought it was over? You could just close the\nChapter and go about your life like it was nothing?\nYou ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine\nWell, I've never recovered\nBut tonight I bet you that what you're\n'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered\nCan't think of a better way to define poetic justice\nCan I hold grudges? Mind saying, \"Let it go, fuck this.\"\nHeart's saying, \"I will, once I bury this bitch alive\nHide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset.\"\n\n[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]\nI flee the scene like it was my last ride\nYou see right through\nOh, you had me pegged the first time\nYou can see the truth, but it's easier to justify\nWhat's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy\nI just hate to be the bad guy\n(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)\nI just hate to be the bad guy\n(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch\nTo think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit\nThink you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?\nNot this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!\nFinish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit\nThought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!\nYou left our family in shambles\nAnd you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?\nMay be gone but he's not forgotten\nAnd don't think \u2018cause he's been out the pictures\nSo long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya\nYou're wrong and that shit was rotten\nAnd the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold\nHave you any idea the shit that I've gone through?\nFeelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?\nNot once you call to ask me how I'm doin'\nLetters, you don't respond to 'em\nFuck it, I'm coming to see you\nAnd, gee, who better to talk to than you?\nThe cause of my problems\nMy life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you\nPoof, then I'm gone, voosh\n\n[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]\nI flee the scene like it was my last ride\nYou see right through\nOh, you had me pegged the first time\nYou can see the truth, but it's easier to justify\nWhat's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy\nI just hate to be the bad guy\n(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)\nI just hate to be the bad guy\n(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)\n\n[Verse 3]\nI've been drivin' around your side of this town\nLike 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now\nFinally I found your new address, park in your drive\nFeel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life\nAnd it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva\nMy knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house\nSee, it's sad it came to this point\nSuch a disappointment I had to make this appointment\nTo come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy\nI don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy\nIt's revenge that I seek\nSo I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window\nLike I reached my full potential: I peeked\nContinue to peep, still bent low, then keep\nTapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak\nAll the way 'round to the back porch\nMan, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this\nYou don't plan for intruders beforehand?\nSurprised to see me?

Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror\n(Oh, God! Police!

Bad Guy is about Stan\u2019s little brother, Matthew, who loved his brother more than anything. Matthew Mitchell is all grown-up now, and is seeking revenge for Stan\u2019s death.\n\nThe song also subtly references Eminem\u2019s \u201c97' Bonnie & Clyde,\u201d where he dumps his wife\u2019s dead body in a river, similarly to how Matthew executes his plan to kill him, almost powerfully echoing the notoriously controversial song.\n\nThe song includes three different voices:\n\n\nFirst is Stan\u2019s brother, rapping in an apparently misogynistic and hyper-aggressive style, just like Eminem\u2019s very early work. Only after the 3rd verse this does become really apparent.\nSecond is a hybrid, starting a 5:12 the fictional brother becomes Eminem\u2019s conscious and takes on a sinister double voice as Eminem is \u201cdying\u201d like Stan did. This portion is quite surprisingly introspective, vulnurable, and self-critical. He\u2019s always been good at this level of honesty, but this verse is really spectacular.\nThe third is his own, who silences the self doubt at 6:50 and tries to explain why he, Eminem, has to keep doing what he\u2019s doing. But this voice sounds tired, it lacks the intensity and power of the first two. Soon this persona fades away, just like the second voice of doubt and conscious said that he would.\n\n\n\nhttp://youtu.be/XNAvf7u6OG4?t=6m53s"}, "embed_content": "<div id='rg_embed_link_235723'

released as a single from The Marshall Mathers LP. \u201cStan\u201d is about a crazed fan who kills himself, his girlfriend and their unborn child because of the \u201clack of attention\u201d Eminem paid to him as a fan. Bad Guy is about Stan\u2019s little brother, Matthew, who loved his brother more than anything. Matthew Mitchell is all grown-up now, and is seeking revenge for Stan\u2019s death.\n\nThe song also subtly references Eminem\u2019s \u201c97' Bonnie & Clyde,\u201d where he dumps his wife\u2019s dead body in a river, similarly to how Matthew executes his plan to kill him, almost powerfully echoing the notoriously controversial song.\n\nThe song includes three different voices:\n\n\nFirst is Stan\u2019s brother, rapping in an apparently misogynistic and hyper-aggressive style, just like Eminem\u2019s very early work. Only after the 3rd verse this does become really apparent.\nSecond is a hybrid, starting a 5:12 the fictional brother becomes Eminem\u2019s conscious and takes on a sinister double voice as Eminem is \u201cdying\u201d like Stan did. This portion is quite surprisingly introspective, vulnurable, and self-critical. He\u2019s always been good at this level of honesty, but this verse is really spectacular.\nThe third is his own, who silences the self doubt at 6:50 and tries to explain why he, Eminem, has to keep doing what he\u2019s doing. But this voice sounds tired, it lacks the intensity and power of the first two. Soon this persona fades away, just like the second voice of doubt and conscious said that he would.\n\n\n\nhttp://youtu.be/XNAvf7u6OG4?t=6m53s"}, "comment_count": 0, "community": true,

You could just close the\nChapter and go about your life like it was nothing?\nYou ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine\nWell, I've never recovered\nBut tonight I bet you that what you're\n'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered\nCan't think of a better way to define poetic justice\nCan I hold grudges? Mind saying, \"Let it go, fuck this.\"\nHeart's saying, \"I will, once I bury this bitch alive\nHide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset.\"\n\n[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]\nI flee the scene like it was my last ride\nYou see right through\nOh, you had me pegged the first time\nYou can see the truth, but it's easier to justify\nWhat's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy\nI just hate to be the bad guy\n(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)\nI just hate to be the bad guy\n(Follow me, I ruh-uh-un; follow me, I ruh-uh-un)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch\nTo think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit\nThink you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?\nNot this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!\nFinish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit\nThought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!\nYou left our family in shambles\nAnd you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?\nMay be gone but he's not forgotten\nAnd don't think \u2018cause he's been out the pictures\nSo long that I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't comin' to get ya\nYou're wrong and that shit was rotten\nAnd the way you played him, same shit you did to me, cold\nHave you any idea the shit that I've gone through?\nFeelings I harbor?

The title describes Marshall himself. This is the first track Eminem has written as an apology to Kim for the pain he\u2019s caused her throughout his personal and public life, even though he already acknowledged Kim\u2019s positive impact on him on \u201cStronger Than I Was\u201d.\n\nEminem has written many songs in the past with Kim as his inspiration, although just about all of them involve Eminem inflicting some sort of violence towards her. On \u201cKim\u201d he cruelly kills her, \u201c\u201897 Bonnie and Clyde\u201d narrates how he dumps the corpse, while \u201cPuke\u201d is just another example in which he portrays his hatred towards his ex-wife.\n\nKim publicly addressed her relationship with Eminem in a TV interview on ABC News' 20/20 in 2007. Here, she argues that Eminem is \u201can excellent father,\u201d but she \u201c[doesn\u2019t] know if he was a good husband or not.\u201d\n\nThroughout Em\u2019s career, he has written songs that express regret in the way he has treated others through his rhymes. Most significantly, he took out some time on his 2013 track to apologize to his mother in \u201cHeadlights\u201d for songs such as \u201cCleanin' Out My Closet\u201d.\n\nIn his December 2017 interview with David Marchese for Vulture, Em remarks on his reconciled relationship with Kim, stating \u201cI\u2019m not killing Kim on songs anymore\u2013we\u2019re good now, and she\u2019s the mother of my

"body": {"plain": "\u201cBad Husband\u201d is an apology directed towards Eminem\u2019s ex-wife, Kim Mathers. The title describes Marshall himself. This is the first track Eminem has written as an apology to Kim for the pain he\u2019s caused her throughout his personal and public life, even though he already acknowledged Kim\u2019s positive impact on him on \u201cStronger Than I Was\u201d.\n\nEminem has written many songs in the past with Kim as his inspiration, although just about all of them involve Eminem inflicting some sort of violence towards her. On \u201cKim\u201d he cruelly kills her, \u201c\u201897 Bonnie and Clyde\u201d narrates how he dumps the corpse, while \u201cPuke\u201d is just another example in which he portrays his hatred towards his ex-wife.\n\nKim publicly addressed her relationship with Eminem in a TV interview on ABC News' 20/20 in 2007. Here, she argues that Eminem is \u201can excellent father,\u201d but she \u201c[doesn\u2019t] know if he was a good husband or not.\u201d\n\nThroughout Em\u2019s career, he has written songs that express regret in the way he has treated others through his rhymes. Most significantly, he took out some time on his 2013 track to apologize to his mother in \u201cHeadlights\u201d for songs such as \u201cCleanin' Out My Closet\u201d.\n\nIn his December 2017 interview with David Marchese for Vulture, Em remarks on his reconciled relationship with Kim, stating \u201cI\u2019m not killing Kim on songs anymore\u2013we\u2019re good now, and she\u2019s the mother of my daughter.\u201d"}, "comment_count": 2, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 13192675, "pinned": false, "share_url": "https://genius.com/13192675", "source": null,

spats and our feuds\nUp back in the news, love taps when I dissed you\nLike it was fun, actually used to run back to the booth\nJump back in the studio, give you a tongue-lashing, then you\nLaughed at the stomach tat with the tombstone\nIt was funny back in our youth\nBut then it wasn\u2019t after we knew\nThat we were done and actually through (And actually through)\nBut if there's one fraction of truth\nIf it could be spun back I would do\nSo many things different (things different)\n'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse\nYou hit me once and that I would use\nTo continue the pattern of abuse\nWhy did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I\u2019m confused\nBecause\u2014\n\n[Chorus: X Ambassadors]\nHow come you can be a lord and a loser?\nHow come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?\nA good dad, but a bad husband\nWhy are you a good father?\nA great dad, but a bad husband\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nYou were the beat I loved with a writer's block\nThe line that's hot, that I forgot\nWe laughed a little, cried a lot\nI'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie\nDay before you went to jail and daily\nHow we'd wait for that mail lady\nOr by the phone for Mom to call\nAnd I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on\nGivin' it one more try despite it all\nYou're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark\nI'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box\nWhen we tied the knot, when we broke the knot\nEvery line we crossed we were supposed to not\nEvery time we fought, the insults they got\u2026 thrown too far\nWords that we said that we didn\u2019t mean\nThe words that we meant that we didn\u2019t say\nThe ones that we thought that we shoulda said\nLetters written that we coulda read\nWhich maybe woulda lead to some good instead\nAnd had this put to bed\nBut I'd be lyin\u2019 still if I said I wasn't sittin' here askin' myself\n\n[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade & Eminem]\nHow come you can be a lord and a loser?\nHow come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?\nA good dad, but a bad husband\nWhy are you a good father?\nA great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (You said)\nForever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)\nBut there\u2019s always another side to a good father\nA great dad, but a bad husband\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nWe brought out the worst in each other\nSomeone had to make the sparring end\n'Cause I loved you, but I hated that me\nAnd I don't wanna see that side again\nBut I'm sorry, Kim\nMore than you could ever comprehend\nLeavin' you was fuckin' harder than\nSawing off a fuckin' body limb\nOnce upon a time we're all we had\nMaybe that's what drew us\nTo each other, it was true love\nShit, we never knew was possible\nWe might have loved each other too much\nAnd maybe that's what made us do what\nWe did to each other, all the screw-ups\n'Cause you always thought that you was\nMore in love with me\nAnd I was thinkin' I was more in love than you was\nFor all the times that we thought it worked\n'Til we saw how wrong we were\nWhen the dust settles now and all the dirt\nIf I touch the rawest nerve\nAll I want is for us not to hurt\nAnd it's been an exhaustive search to find the words\nBut I just heard \"Mockingbird\"\nAnd got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts\nThe purpose was not to stir up or open wounds\nI've caused a few and so have you\nOr argue whose fault it was\nPartly yours, partly mine, but really no one's\nThis is so tough, I'm gettin' choked up\nOh fuck it, we both suck\nWe broke up, got back together\nWe both thought we had forever\nNot bad people, just bad together\nWe were so nuts, backstabbed each other\nAnother blow struck, but there's no duckin' this blow\n'Cause it's over and it's closure\nBut I'm not so sure how to close this\nI just don't know how some people can be so good\nAt one thing and so fucked at a whole nother\nShit, it's no wonder\n\n[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade, Eminem]\nHow come, how come, you can be a lord and a loser?\nHow come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?\nA good dad, but a bad husband\nWhy are you a good father?\nA great dad, but a bad husband (Dad) (You said)\nForever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)\nBut there's always another side to a good father\nA great dad, but a bad husband"}}, {"title": "Bad Influence", "album": "End of Days", "year": "1999-11-02", "lyrics": "[Hook]\n(Just pull the plug!)

Blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out\nFuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now\n\n[Hook]\n(Just pull the plug!)

Yo, I done heard worse\nWe can get in two cars and accelerate at each other\nTo see which one'll swerve first\nTwo blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets\nKissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level\nIs hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto\nDismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist\nInterceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot\nOne track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse\nIn my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse\nAnd stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation\nCollaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth\n\n[Hook 1: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9\"]\n\u2018Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil\nWe hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people\nHe's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal\nAbove the law \u2018cause I don't agree with police either\nShit, me neither\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9\"]\nWe ain't eager to be legal\nSo please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle\nI breathe ether in three lethal amounts\nWhile I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle\nReleasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range\nCold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain\n(He's insane!) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up\nAnd I'm pissed off, \u2018cause I can't find a decent vein\n\n[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nThe disaster with dreads, I'm bad enough to commit suicide\nAnd survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead\nWhen in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter\n\u2018Cause I serve any stranger with money\nI spray a hundred, man, until they joint chains\nWhile slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches\nPiss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral\nService lobby and strangle your body to confirm it\nWhippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws\nWith my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass\nI'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees\nSomehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me\nFrom all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough\nTo cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt\n\n[Spoken: Eminem]\nHello? (Ayo, what\u2019s up?)\nWe're coming to get you!\n(Stop! THEY KNOW IT\u2019S US!!!)\n\n[Verse 5: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9\"]\nI used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (Huh-uh?)\nI'm the one who burned your house down (Oh), well, I'm out now (Shit!)\nAnd this time I'm comin' back to blow your house up\nAnd I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of\nGive me two fat tabs and three shrooms\nAnd you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms\nAnd when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave\nI'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe\n\n[Hook 2: Royce Da 5'9\" & Eminem]\n\u2018Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil\nAnd we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people\nHe's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal\nAgainst peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel\n(We'll be waiting) See you in Hell\nWall Street, Royce Da 5'9\", Slim Shady\nSee you in Hell for the sequel (Bye-bye!)\nBad Meets Evil, what?

with these here parts\nYou know, there's a story behind that there saloon\nTwenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over\nSheriffs couldn't stop 'em\nQuickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen\nGot murdered in cold-blood\nThat old saloon there was their little 'home away from home'\nThey say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern\nAnd on a quiet night, you can still hear\nThe footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce Da 5'9\"\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem]\nI don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet\nI'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat\nI translate when my voice is read through a seismograph\nAnd the noise is spread\nPicked up and transmitted through Royce's head\nTrap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed\n'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead\nTold him each one of his boys is dead\nI asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said\n\n[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nWho hard? Yo, I done heard worse\nWe can get in two cars and accelerate at each other\nTo see which one'll swerve first\nTwo blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets\nKissed the cheek of the Devil, intelligence level\nIs hellier than treble peakin' on speakers in the ghetto\nDismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist\nInterceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a patriot\nOne track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse\nIn my past life, when the black knight mounted the white horse\nAnd stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation\nCollaboratin', attemptin' to take over the Earth\n\n[Hook 1: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9\"]\n\u2018Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil\nWe hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people\nHe's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal\nAbove the law \u2018cause I don't agree with police either\nShit, me neither\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9\"]\nWe ain't eager to be legal\nSo please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle\nI breathe ether in three lethal amounts\nWhile I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle\nReleasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range\nCold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain\n(He's insane!) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up\nAnd I'm pissed off, \u2018cause I can't find a decent vein\n\n[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9\"]\nThe disaster with dreads, I'm bad enough to commit suicide\nAnd survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead\nWhen in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter\n\u2018Cause I serve any stranger with money\nI spray a hundred, man, until they joint chains\nWhile slippin' bullets at point-blank range like they was punches\nPiss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral\nService lobby and strangle your body to confirm it\nWhippin' human ass, throwin' blows, crackin' jaws\nWith my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass\nI'm blazin' emcees, at the same time amazin' emcees\nSomehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raisin' to me\nFrom all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough\nTo cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt\n\n[Spoken: Eminem]\nHello? (Ayo, what\u2019s up?)\nWe're coming to get you!\n(Stop! THEY KNOW IT\u2019S US!!!)\n\n[Verse 5: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9\"]\nI used to be a loudmouth, remember me? (Huh-uh?)\nI'm the one who burned your house down (Oh), well, I'm out now (Shit!)\nAnd this time I'm comin' back to blow your house up\nAnd I ain't gon' leave you with a window to jump out of\nGive me two fat tabs and three shrooms\nAnd you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms\nAnd when I go to hell and I'm gettin' ready to leave\nI'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe\n\n[Hook 2: Royce Da 5'9\" & Eminem]\n\u2018Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil\nAnd we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people\nHe's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal\nAgainst peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel\n(We'll be waiting) See you in Hell\nWall Street, Royce Da 5'9\", Slim Shady\nSee you in Hell for the sequel (Bye-bye!)\nBad Meets Evil, what? ('Til next time)\n\n[Outro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]\nAnd so that's the story when Bad meets Evil\nTwo of the most wanted individuals in the county\nMade Jesse James and Billy the Kid\nLook like law-abiding citizens\nIt's too bad they had to go out the way they did\nGot shot in the back coming out of that old saloon\nBut their spirits still live on 'til this day\nShhh\u2026  wait, d'y'all hear that?"}}, {"title": "Bad Meets Evil Original", "album": null, "year": null, "lyrics": "[Produced by Dr. Seuss]\n\n[Eminem]\nArsonist, blocking a fire hose where the nozzle is\nGo to hospitals, steal the blood that tests positive\nTake it home, pour it in a cup and drink lots of it\nTrying on your mother's clothes, trying to get these bras to fit\nWhen she comes home, I'm waiting in the closet, with\nA\ufeff knife, hiding so quiet she'll probably hear the faucet drip\nAll my life I've been a foster kid\nSo if I die an early death suicide's gon' be the cause of it\n\n[Royce Da 5'9]\nWho hard?

and drink lots of it\nTrying on your mother's clothes, trying to get these bras to fit\nWhen she comes home, I'm waiting in the closet, with\nA\ufeff knife, hiding so quiet she'll probably hear the faucet drip\nAll my life I've been a foster kid\nSo if I die an early death suicide's gon' be the cause of it\n\n[Royce Da 5'9]\nWho hard? yo I done heard worse\nWe can get in two cars and accelerate at each other\nTo see which one'll swerve first\nTwo blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds\nThat of a globe on top of nine other planets\nKissed the cheek of the devil\nIntelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto\nDismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist\nIntercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot\nOne track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse\nIn my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse\nThen one get at you, dash you in the back of a Chevrolet\nSpittin shit at you faster than your eardrum could ever play\n\n[Eminem]\nCuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil\nWe hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people\nHe's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal\nAbove the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either (shit, me neither)\n\n[Eminem]\nWe ain't eager to be legal\nSo please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle\nI breathe ether in three lethal amounts\nWhen I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle\nReleasin rage on anybody in squeezing range\nCold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain\n(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off\nCuz I can't find a decent vein\n\n[Royce Da 5'9]\nThe disaster wit dreds\nI'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough\nTo kill my soul after I'm dead\nWhen in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter\nCuz I serve any stranger wit money\nI spray a hundred, man until they joint chains\nWhile slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches\nI got a lot of evil; I got knowledge peeking out of my cerebral now that I got people locked and rock evil\nWhile still on the beat, I hit you in your ribs so hard to think its just a touch to the floor, while your still on your feet\nI'm blazin MC's, at the same time amazin MC's Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me\nDestroying the track, un-employing the whack, exploring the facts while my man Eminem is withdrawing from crack\n\n[Girl voice crying]\nI just love him..\nI just love him..\n\n[Royce Da 5'9]\nWho hard? yo I done heard worse\nWe can get in two cars and accelerate at
